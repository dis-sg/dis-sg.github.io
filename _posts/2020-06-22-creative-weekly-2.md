Note: Coronavirus stories still dominate the news cycle, which leaves little room for design-related ones. Until the situation returns to normal (or the 'new normal'), Creative Weekly would be published fortnightly.

<h2>Artists are ‘non-essential’</h2>

In a viral infographic circulated on social media, artists were found to have the least essential job, according to 1000 survey respondents.

The Straits Times <a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/manpower/8-in-10-singaporeans-willing-to-pay-more-for-essential-services">article</a> which carried this infographic was actually reporting on a totally different topic: that a majority of Singaporeans are willing to pay workers in essential services more. Nowhere in the written article did the journalist elaborate on the 5 non-essential jobs listed. 

Artists reacted in the best way they know: through art.

I have strong opinions about the infographic which I saved for an opinion piece <a href="https://dis-sg.github.io/artists-non-essential/">here</a>. 

Anyway, this is what would happen if all ST artists were retrenched for being non-essential, brought to you by Microsoft Word:

<h2>Making a Moove</h2>

Come 2022, the plot once known as Grange Road carpark would be transformed into an ambitious events space, designed by DP Architects. 

Landlease Reit, which also manages the neighbouring 313 Somerset, hopes this space would breathe new life into an increasingly deserted Orchard Road. 

The planned space boosts influential local and international tenants, including live entertainment company Live Nation and film theatre The Projector. An artistinal hawker concept is also thrown into the mix. How DP Architects managed to fit everything into a carpark-sized plot of land deserves an award in itself.

As we enter into the era of experiential shopping, this space looks poised for the future.
