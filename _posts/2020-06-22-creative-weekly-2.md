Note: Coronavirus stories still dominate the news cycle, which leaves little room for design-related ones. Until the situation returns to normal (or the 'new normal'), Creative Weekly would be published fortnightly.

<h2>Artists are ‘non-essential’<h/2>

In a viral infographic circulated on social media, artists were found to have the least essential job, according to 1000 survey respondents.

The Straits Times <a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/manpower/8-in-10-singaporeans-willing-to-pay-more-for-essential-services">article</a> which carried this infographic was actually reporting on a totally different topic: that a majority of Singaporeans are willing to pay workers in essential services more. Nowhere in the written article did the journalist elaborate on the 5 non-essential jobs listed. 

Artists reacted in the best way they know: through art.

I have strong opinions about the infographic which I saved for an opinion piece <a href="https://dis-sg.github.io/artists-non-essential/">here</a>. 

Anyway, this is what would happen if all ST artists were retrenched for being non-essential, brought to you by Microsoft Word:
