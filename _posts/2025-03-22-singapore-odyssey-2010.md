<h2>Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, hey!</h2>

It was March 2010 and Singapore was gearing up to host the inaugural Youth Olympic Games (YOG). Mascots Lyo and Merly had already been introduced and merchandise was lining store shelves.

    <p>As a sporting event for youths, the organising committee could not ignore the hottest trend that was revolutionising communication—social media. The last Olympic Games had been held in China, which has the Great Firewall, making YOG 2010 arguably the first Olympic Games to fully embrace social media.</p>

    <p>But YOG 2010 went further than this. Besides launching a “WhyOhGee” microsite which provided youth-friendly resources on the Olympics and encouraged user-generated content, an entire virtual world was created to market the event.</p>

    <p>The Singapore 2010 Odyssey game was described as a “three-dimensional virtual world modelled after the Singapore 2010 Youth Olympic Games and the ideals of the Olympic Movement”. Set in 3010, players could participate in YOG sports virtually and interact with each other. There was even an option for players to code their own content on the platform.</p>

    <p>Players could explore different landmarks in Singapore, which, interestingly, seemed unchanged even a thousand years into the future—Suntec City still had the Fountain of Wealth, and Pulau Ubin retained its rustic charm.</p>

    <p>In contrast, the sporting facilities looked futuristic, featuring aquamarine neon lights and sleek glass surfaces, giving them a high-tech aesthetic.</p>

    <p>Beyond Olympic sports, players could try out random mini-games like whack-a-mole, a Tetris clone, and even a recycling-themed game where they sorted trash into the correct bins.</p>

    <p>The game offered generous avatar customisation options, allowing players to buy outfits and accessories using sports credits earned through gameplay. The in-game shop was named Boomzwear, a nod to Miss Singapore 2009 Ris Low’s viral “boomz” catchphrase.</p>

    <p>The End of Odyssey</p>
    <p>After YOG 2010, the game was rebranded to Odyssey (<a href="https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100067269990618#" target="_blank">(Source)</a>), which positioned itself as a “futuristic 3D Virtual World where youths from across the world can interact with each other while travelling through space and time”.</p>

    <p>For a game designed to connect youths worldwide, it was an odd choice for the first non-sports scenario to transport players to Singapore in 1942, during the Japanese Occupation.</p>

    <iframe src="https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fpermalink.php%3Fstory_fbid%3D151656218224287%26id%3D116865108382500&show_text=true&width=500" width="500" height="250" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

    <p>This was Odyssey’s first and last Facebook post—the game was likely shut down due to low player numbers. Even though there were over 200,000 accounts, the momentum could not last after the YOG 2010. In the end, players probably found more engaging virtual worlds elsewhere, rather than revisiting a dark chapter of Singapore’s history.</p>

    <p>A Moment in Time</p>
    <p>Today, creating an entire multiplayer online game as a marketing tool for an event is almost unheard of. Instead, brands turn to established sandbox platforms like Fortnite or Roblox, where they can develop custom experiences without building an entire game from scratch.</p>

    <p>Nonetheless, building a full-fledged multiplayer platform from the ground up was a remarkable achievement. Despite technical limitations and a lack of prior references, the game successfully captivated schoolchildren, many of whom looked forward to exploring its world during IT class instead of learning PowerPoint.</p>

    <p>Just don’t ask if it actually inspired them to be more active in sports after spending hours running virtual marathons instead.</p>
