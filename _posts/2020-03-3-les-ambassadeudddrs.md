Uncertain times bring about business opportunities for those who dare to seize them. Due to the coronavirus, many traditional shops are going online to remain accessible to customers. Tekka Online Market, an initiative by the IMDA, is leading this pivot to digitisation. 

Led by fellow Tekka Market vendor and Facebook Live veteran Max Kee, six vendors started selling goods ranging from poultry to dried foods on 5th May. Since then, Tekka Online Market’s Facebook page, where the action happens, has grown to over 17,000 followers. Its visual identity was created by BLKJ. 

<h2>Lelong Lelong</h2>
Tekka Online Market’s branding is a joy to see. The colours command your attention, and cheeky copy (siam the crowds) calms the nerves of customers who are trying “online marketing” for the first time. Overall, the branding is inviting and familiar, thanks to its use of retro-inspired brutalism.

Just because this initiative was likely created in light of slower business does not mean it should be all doom and gloom. The colours are bright and cheerful, fitting for the equally cheerful vendors who are new to the online scene. 

Most impressive are the posters and videos which introduce the different Tekka vendors. The playful GIF posters add to the fun of buying market produce online, while clever and localised copy hits all the sweet spots of branding.

Even the live videos are branded - the backdrop provides instructions on how to order during Facebook Live.
