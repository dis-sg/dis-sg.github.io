GE2020 saw the Progress Singapore Party (PSP) fielding the most candidates as an opposition party, but its closest fight came just 2% shy of beating the incumbent People’s Action Party (PAP). It was an impressive result for a new party, but it leaves PSP in an awkward situation: with founder and Secretary-General Dr Tan Cheng Bock’s eventual retirement, can this party continue to grow from strength to strength? 

PSP’s branding seems to give us some clues.

<h2>Logo</h2>
Whether Dr Tan likes it or not, the PSP logo has made clear references to him. Dr Tan’s 2011 Presidential bid was represented by a palm symbol, visually similar to the standard postage stamp by SingPost. He said in a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/TanChengBock/posts/163031897104687" target="_blank">Facebook post</a> that “leaves of the palm represent our multiracial society, the trunk represents them coming together, and the roots represent us taking root in Singapore”. It was an unpolished symbol but good enough for a presidential election, where faces tend to take centre-stage.

The latest iteration of the palm for the PSP is most refined. The almost-symmetrical logo (check the leaf cuts) is simple but unique enough to be recognised as a logo, something with other new parties such as <a href="https://dis-sg.github.io/creative-weekly-3/" target="_blank">Red Dot United</a> struggled with. 

While PSP’s logo does not pack the same punch as PAP’s lightning, it already has an unofficial decade-long history of representing one of Singapore’s most popular politicians. With a few electoral wins, the logo has the potential to dominate the public consciousness of local politics.

As for the meaning behind the logo, the first 15 seconds of this video sums it up:

The logo’s ‘person-shaped trunk’ represents that people are the PSP’s core interest and source of strength. The party’s <a href="https://psp.org.sg/vision/" target="_blank">website</a> explains its brand identity in greater detail.

<h2>Mascot</h2>
Singapore’s otter craze never really went away since we began spotting them in parks and riversides. Amatuer videos of their latest territorial ventures continue to make the news periodically.

Otica, PSP’s mascot, leverages the local popularity of the animal and makes a cute election souvenir. The ‘pretty please’ pose is disarming, fitting for its role as PSP’s Chief Compassion Officer. is If the logo was smaller, Otica could even become a trendy gift for kids.
