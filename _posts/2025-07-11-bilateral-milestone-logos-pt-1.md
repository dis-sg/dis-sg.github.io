<h2>Featuring 🇸🇬, 💐 and 🦁 </h2>

Singapore has many friends, which bolsters its status as a global hub despite being a tiny red dot on the map.

As the nation celebrates its 60th birthday this year, it also marks significant milestones in diplomatic ties with several countries. Many of these anniversaries are commemorated through special logos, which brand cultural events, exchanges, and initiatives throughout the year.

These logos often combine visual elements from both nations to convey a sense of shared identity and friendship. In doing so, they also reflect how Singapore wants to be seen by the world through design.

Let’s take a closer look at some of these anniversary logos:

<h2>South Korea (50 years)</h2>

To mark 50 years of friendship, the commemorative logo combines elements from both countries’ flags—the yin symbol and stylised trigram from South Korea and Singapore’s canton design—to form a “50”. The logo was the winning entry of a competition featuring entries from Korea National University of Arts and Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts students.

Owing to its “rojak” composition, the “50” is more clearly seen when viewed in smaller sizes, particularly the negative space formed by the crescent moon which forms the “0”.

A slew of activities have been planned throughout the year, ranging from arts performances to travel fairs.

<h2>The Netherlands (60 years)</h2>

In keeping with Dutch design sensibilities, the logo which celebrates 60 years of diplomatic ties between Singapore and the Netherlands (SG-NL60) features clean illustrations of an orchid and tulip, which are their respective national flowers. A blue circle, which reflects both countries’ shared maritime trade links, completes the symmetrical logo.

The logo was designed by local creative agency <a href="https://kingscom.com/about/" target="_blank">Kingscom</a>. 

<h2>China (35 years)</h2>

The logo celebrating 35 years of diplomatic relations between China and Singapore also features both national flowers, but takes a more ornate approach. Bathed in an orange-red gradient, flowers are illustrated in greater detail and rests on a thin, art deco-inspired “35”. Very red, very huat.

<h2>Thailand (60 years)</h2>

Under the theme “Realising Opportunities for New Growth – Strong@60,” the logo incorporates the national animals of both countries—the lion and the elephant. The elephant’s tusk morphs into a thin strip of the Thai flag, forming the bottom half of the zero, while the Singapore flag outlines the top.

This logo could have done without the flags, as the majestic illustration of the lion-elephant composite contrasts awkwardly with the carnival-like, stringy flags. This awkwardness is compounded by the design of Singapore’s flag, which leaves little room for the crescent moon and stars that vanish when the logo is viewed in small sizes.


<h2>Germany (60 years)</h2>

Shortly after the launch of the Germany-Singapore strategic partnership last year, the logo which celebrates 60 years of bilateral relations was unveiled by the German Embassy in Singapore. 

The logo resembles the infinity symbol woven by both flag designs, and represents “not only friendship and connection, but also resilience, sustainability, and limitless potential as (both countries) grow together”. The straightness of the infinity symbol may be an unintended reflection of the Germans love for orderliness and precision.

<h2>Special Mention: Malaysia (60 years)</h2>

Although no official logo was created for this milestone, the Petronas Twin Towers were illuminated in the national colours of both Singapore and Malaysia during PM Wong’s visit for the Malaysia-Singapore Leaders’ Retreat.

The towers are perhaps the best billboard of bilateralism, as each tower can represent a country with the skybridge standing in as a handshake.
