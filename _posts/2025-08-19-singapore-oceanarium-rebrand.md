<h2>In its edutainment era 🐟💡</h2>

If you had the privilege of visiting the now-defunct Underwater World in its heyday, you would likely remember the mindblowing entrance tunnel which offered a 180 degree view of marine life - a novelty in the 1990s. 

30 years later, with high quality videos of the rarest fish a Google search away, Resorts World Sentosa’s S.E.A. Aquarium has reinvented itself to avoid the fate of Underwater World, which was once one of Sentosa’s biggest draws. 

Already one of the world’s largest oceanarium by total water volume, the 12 year old attraction is now three times larger, highlighting its educational mission and goes by a new name: Singapore Oceanarium.

<h2>What’s in a Name </h2>
While S.E.A. Aquarium’s name had a double meaning, Singapore Oceanarium is as plain as it gets. The corporate-sounding new name helps brand the research findings that come from the newly-opened Research and Learning Centre, described as a “cornerstone of the Singapore Oceanarium”. Consisting of a lab, classrooms and event spaces, the centre aims to support research efforts and host international conferences on marine conservation.

Singapore Oceanarium also plays it safe with the new brand identity, ditching the school of fish for a gradient wave pattern.

The wordmark has more personality, adopting an art-deco inspired curved typeface with modified crossbars to resemble a wave. It is corporate with a dash of fun.

On social media, the effective use of the typeface and lock-ups give Singapore Oceanarium a polished look.

<h2>New Look</h2>
One of Singapore Oceanarium’s major changes is the revamped entrance, which now looks like a portal instead of a traditional entranceway. A fitting introduction to the foreign nature of aquatic life.

22 zones await visitors, including “Ocean Wonders”, which introduces one of the ocean’s most ancient survivors - sea jellies, and “Singapore’s Coast”, where visitors can explore local mangrove species in air-conditioned comfort. In the last zone, visitors can make an e-pledge to marine conservation.

Through interactive storytelling, visitors can feel immersed in deep-sea expeditions, learn more about how shipwrecks become artificial habitats, and act as ice shelves collapse - a stark reminder of global warming. All 22 zones piece together our limited understanding of the ever mysterious puzzle that is our oceans.

<h2>Trendy Waves </h2>
As one of the top attractions in Singapore, the Singapore Oceanarium continues to leverage trends for a steady stream of visitors, both local and from abroad. Late last year, S.E.A. Aquarium collaborated with Genshin Impact, where fans could embark on an interactive stamp rally, explore aquatic-themed Genshin installations and purchase limited edition merchandise.

Move aside, Labubu - Singapore Oceanarium also jumped on the blind box bandwagon by bundling them with admission tickets during its opening weekend.

In many ways, Singapore’s success can be attributed to its strategic maritime location. It is only fitting that we have a world-class maritime life research centre and attraction that tells our Singapore story from the perspective of conservation efforts - literally 饮水思源 (when you drink water, think of its source).
