In this creative weekly, we cover HDB's August BTO launch, 

<h2>BTO Sales Launch</h2>

Close to 8,000 BTO units across eight estates were put on sale this month. Despite the large number of units available compared to previous exercises, the flats were oversubscribed just one day into the sale period.

Some BTO project logos highlight features which make each of them unique - Parc Residences @ Tengah’s curved rooflines, Bishan Towers’ sky terraces and UrbanVille @ Woodlands’ skybridge. 

Others just take cues from the project’s name, resulting in fairly uninspiring logos. Cliche word-graphic pairings made some logos worse than just a wordmark - Tampines GreenGlade’s logo would look less amateurish without the leaf.

Facade-wise, Parc Residences @ Tengah offers the most interesting look with bright orange curved rooflines extending right to the ground floor. The project’s location in Singapore’s first car-lite town also means it is a testbed for new green technologies, including a centralised cooling system which successful BTO applicants can opt in for.

Meanwhile, UrbanVille @ Woodlands’ design more closely resembles a condominium than a BTO. Its two main blocks look majestic and are set to become the focal point of Woodlands’ town centre.

<h2>EcoTOTE </h2>

Proof & Company might just have created a solution to ending single-use glass in the bar industry. Under their <a href="https://ecospirits.global/" target="_blank">ecoSPIRITS</a> distribution system, bars have the opportunity to reduce packaging and transport costs, thereby reducing their carbon footprint.

At the centre of ecoSPIRITS is the ecoTOTE, a reusable glass vessel which can be refilled up to 40 times before being sent for sanitisation. The lime-green vessels look like mini-fridges and the matte finish makes them look sophisticated. Vessels can also be labelled, ensuring a consistent brand experience as much as possible for spirit makers.
