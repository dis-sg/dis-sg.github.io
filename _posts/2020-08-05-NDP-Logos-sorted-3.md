The tradition of having a logo represent a National Day Parade (NDP) first began in 1998. Each logo has a complementary identity system which helps to brand parade paraphernalia and props. 

With NDP 2020, 23 logos have been created to celebrate Singapore's birthday. Earlier in this series, the logos were sorted according to <a href="https://dis-sg.github.io/NDP-Logos-sorted-1/" target="_blank">graphical elements</a> and <a href="https://dis-sg.github.io/NDP-Logos-sorted-2/" target="_blank">colour schemes</a>. This post would focus on sorting them by typography. The two broad categories are: typeface and written content.

<h2>Typeface Category</h2>
While typefaces have many classifications, the most basic distinction is whether the typeface is serif or sans-serif. Serif typefaces generally convey a more formal tone compared to their san-serif counterparts. This category sorts the logos according to serifs, sans-serifs and handwriting, which is a subcategory of sans-serifs. 

<h3>Logos with Serif Type</h3>

Feel-good NDP celebrations leave little room for serious typefaces to appear in NDP logos, which explains why there are only three logos in this subcategory. 

In NDP 2015’s logo, the serifed ‘Majulah Singapura’ slogan added gravitas to the golden jubilee celebration. NDP 1999’s logo made the event seem like a black tie affair, as ‘NDP’ was spelt out and in capital letters, complete with a full-stop after the slogan. It remains the only (and hopefully last) time a full-stop appeared in an NDP logo.

<h3>Logos with Sans-Serif Type</h3>

A large majority of NDP logos used sans-serif typefaces but they were by no means identical. The spectrum of sans-serifs range from the cartoony, comic book typeface of NDP 2014’s logo to the angular, futuristic typeface used in NDP 2017. 

This year’s typeface tastefully complements the rounded edges of the NDP graphic, creating visual consistency. The geometric, tightly packed typeface also helps to sell the idea of togetherness and strength, as mentioned in the slogan.

Fun fact: NDP 2001’s logo used the default Microsoft font Tahoma. Now you know why the font looks so familiar!

<h3>Logos with Handwriting Type</h3>
