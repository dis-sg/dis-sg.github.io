This pandemic election has given parties a new accessory to brand - masks. Sure, most politicians would prefer to wear a smile, but politics has always been about adaptability and compromise. Let us look at some notable examples.

<h2>The Workers’ Party</h2>
The Workers’ Party arguably has it easiest. Disposable surgical masks are already blue, and close to the shade of their baby blue party shirts. An added bonus is that these masks are way easier to breathe in than cloth masks, which are perfect for a physically-intensive campaign.

Marine Parade GRC candidate Yee Jenn Jong personalised his mask by pinning on the WP badge. Simple but significant.

<h2>Singapore Democratic Alliance</h2>
SDA’s specially printed masks feature Singapore’s silhouette, the party logo and ‘Singapore My Land’ in Impact font (the meme font). These masks were not created with visibility in mind, as it would be difficult to read the slogan from a distance. The silhouette and gradient distracts from the message too.

Impressively, SDA also printed the slogan in Malay and Tamil. I could not find a picture of a mask with the Chinese slogan, but it should be safe to say that it was printed as well.

Props to them for trying something different, but unless your message is something specific to your party (literally every other party can say that ‘Singapore is our land’), it is better not to overdesign. After all, less is more.

<h2>Progress Singapore Party</h2>
PSP’s no-frills mask is in stark contrast to SDA’s. All candidates and volunteers are donned in party colours, with Tan Cheng Bock going a step further by wearing the party cap. A red PSP mask completes the look, shows that the party wastes no opportunity to showcase their brand (they even have branded tissue packets).
