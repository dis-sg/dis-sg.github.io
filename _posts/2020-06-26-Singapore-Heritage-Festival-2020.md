The <a href="https://www.heritagefestival.sg/">Singapore Heritage Festival</a> (SHF) is one of the key events organised by the National Heritage Board annually. This yearâ€™s digital edition is a first in its 17 year history, and is set to run from June 19 to July 5. Each week, SHF would dedicate programmes to a heritage-rich neighbourhood - Tanjong Pagar, Pasir Ris, and Kallang.

<h2>Visual Identity</h2>

SHF has always excelled in presenting eye-catching identities. Nostalgia sells by itself, but putting a contemporary spin on visuals separates SHF from the pack of heritage fan pages.
