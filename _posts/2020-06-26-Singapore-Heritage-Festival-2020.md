The <a href="https://www.heritagefestival.sg/">Singapore Heritage Festival</a> (SHF) is one of the key events organised by the National Heritage Board annually. This year’s digital edition is a first in its 17 year history, and is set to run from June 19 to July 5. Each week, SHF would dedicate programmes to a heritage-rich neighbourhood - Tanjong Pagar, Pasir Ris, and Kallang.

<h2>Visual Identity</h2>

SHF has always excelled in presenting eye-catching identities. Nostalgia sells by itself, but putting a contemporary spin on visuals separates SHF from the pack of heritage fan pages.

This year’s identity features colourful illustrations of people having fun, such as beach life in Pasir Ris. The illustrations were created by artist <a href="https://www.instagram.com/lepaklukis/">Muhammad Izdi</a>.

Article thumbnails place these illustrations front and centre against clean backdrops. The thumbnails could have been larger to balance the clutter of words on the site, though.

SHF’s social media posts follow a colour scheme which helps to differentiate which neighbourhood it is celebrating that week. Granted, all 3 neighbourhoods do not really have colours which define them (as opposed to Redhill), but the bold colours command your attention while scrolling.

<h2>Projects to Visit</h2>

With 80 programmes stretching across different fields of interest, it is easy to get disorientated and miss out on something interesting. While new content is being created for this event, I found most design-related ones to be previous NHB projects. Here are some of them:

<i>Architectural Heritage Awards Video Series</i>

This <a href="https://www.heritagefestival.sg/programmes/urantu-films-on-architectural-heritage-awards-aha">series</a> of short videos showcases the stories behind the Singapore’s Architectural Heritage Award recipients. Made by NTU WKWSCI students, these videos feature interviews with the buildings’ custodians, offering insight into what makes the buildings great. 

<i>City Stories</i>

This <a href="http://citystories.sg/">project</a> is an exploration of Telok Ayer and Amoy Streets’ histories through before-after photographs, videos and more. Made in collaboration with NTU ADM students, transport yourself back to 1984 and hear audio testimonies of people who have seen the streets evolve to what we know today as a hipster hangout.

Many of the new programmes are family-friendly but still worth visiting. 

<i>Dear Tanjong Pagar</i>

Dear <a href="https://deartanjongpagar.com/">Tanjong Pagar</a> follows the lives of 3 anthropomorphic animals in 1900s Singapore, through their jobs as wayang performers and rickshaw coolies. Created by <a href="http://www.caketheatre.com/sweet-tooth/4576018251">Sweet Tooth</a>, this site is a package of family fun, with minigames, animated shorts and even background music. 

<i>Colour Sheets</i>

For those who love colouring or just want a temporary getaway from life’s shenanigans (ahem GE 2020), artist Tobyato created 3 colouring sheets highlighting icons of the featured neighbourhoods: Tanjong Pagar’s Metropole Cinema, Kallang Stadium and the Bumboat Playground of Pasir Ris. The coloured versions can be found on NHB’s Facebook page.
