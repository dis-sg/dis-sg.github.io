The <a href="https://www.heritagefestival.sg/">Singapore Heritage Festival</a> (SHF) is one of the key events organised by the National Heritage Board annually. This year’s digital edition is a first in its 17 year history, and is set to run from June 19 to July 5. Each week, SHF would dedicate programmes to a heritage-rich neighbourhood - Tanjong Pagar, Pasir Ris, and Kallang.

<h2>Visual Identity</h2>

SHF has always excelled in presenting eye-catching identities. Nostalgia sells by itself, but putting a contemporary spin on visuals separates SHF from the pack of heritage fan pages.

This year’s identity features colourful illustrations of people having fun, such as beach life in Pasir Ris. The illustrations were created by artist <a href="https://www.instagram.com/lepaklukis/">Muhammad Izdi</a>.

Article thumbnails place these illustrations front and centre against clean backdrops. The thumbnails could have been larger to balance the clutter of words on the site, though.

SHF’s social media posts follow a colour scheme which helps to differentiate which neighbourhood it is celebrating that week. Granted, all 3 neighbourhoods do not really have colours which define them (as opposed to Redhill), but the bold colours command your attention while scrolling.

<h2>Projects to Visit</h2>

With 80 programmes stretching across different fields of interest, it is easy to get disorientated and miss out on something interesting. While new content is being created for this event, I found most design-related ones to be previous NHB projects. Here are some of them:
