The Singapore Heritage Festival (SHF) is one of the key events organised by the National Heritage Board annually. This yearâ€™s digital edition is a first in its 17 year history, and is set to run from June 19 to July 5. Each week, SHF would dedicate programmes to a heritage-rich neighbourhood - Tanjong Pagar, Pasir Ris, and Kallang.
