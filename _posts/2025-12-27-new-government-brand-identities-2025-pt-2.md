<h2>More than just SG60 🔴</h2>

<i>Read part 1 of this series.</i>

This year was unsurprisingly busy for the world’s best public administration. With SG60 and several agencies hitting milestone anniversaries, a wave of new brand identities were unveiled, ranging from large-scale revamps to subtle design tweaks.

Here are some of them:
<br>
<h1>Rebrands</h1>
<h2>Ministry of Manpower</h2>

The Ministry of Manpower unveiled its refreshed logo during its 70th anniversary celebration in April. Its first rebrand since its name change from the Ministry of Labour in 1999, the new brandmark keeps the spirit of the original logo by simplifying it and using a more contrasting colour palette to stand out in the digital age. 

<blockquote>
The circle at the top of the logo reflects our focus on people — employers, employees, and MOMers – highlighting that they are at the heart of everything we do. Three distinctive stripes represent the vital tripartite partnership between government, employers, and unions, emphasising our collaborative efforts to create a resilient and dynamic workforce. The colour palette balances stability and relatability: a dark blue, signifying trust and stability; a modern blue representing adaptability and innovation; and an orange accent adding warmth and relatability.
<br><br>
Together, these elements underscore MOM's unique role – dedicated to empowering individuals, creating opportunities for growth, and ensuring Singapore’s workforce remains globally competitive.

The new brand identity also included a trendy bold serif, a handwriting typeface and social media templates for easy plug and play content creation.

<h2>President’s Challenge</h2>

Although President Tharman was elected in 2023, the logo for the President’s Challenge was only changed this year. The logo was designed by Xandrea Alfie Isa from Temasek Polytechnic, who won the student logo design competition in early 2025 (<a href="https://www.facebook.com/PresidentsChallenge/posts/congratulations-to-xandrea-alfie-isa-from-temasek-polytechnic-the-grand-winner-o/1087326726760865/" target="_blank">merit winner designs</a> were also shared on social media).

<blockquote>
This thoughtfully crafted logo embodies the values of unity, empowerment, and upliftment. At its heart of the design, the letters P and C are intertwined in a continuous loop – symbolising an unbreakable cycle of unity and inclusivity. Together, the elements create a powerful and meaningful emblem that reflects a community rising together, driven by heart and purpose.

A metallic polish was added to the logo in motion graphic placements throughout the President's Challenge Night programme.

<div class="video-responsive"><iframe width="1905" height="742" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nR6CUu_dIZc" title="President&#39;s Challenge Night 2025 - Trailer" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe> </div>

The loop in the logo has since been incorporated as a design element in President’s Challenge content, including social media posts.

<h2>Building and Construction Authority</h2>

This blink-and-you-miss-it tweak — launched with zero fanfare — was so subtle that the change could only be seen when the logo is viewed on a larger screen. The new logo thins the right ends of the foundations, creating a 3D feel, while the building tops now arch upwards. The logotype now uses a thicker typeface, which gels nicely with the revised brandmark.

<h2>Lifelong Learning Singapore</h2>

Formerly known as the Lifelong Learning Institute, Lifelong Learning Singapore (LLSG) has grown from merely managing the learning campus to the main outreach and engagement arm of SkillsFuture Singapore, where it connects Singaporeans to training, jobs, and skills opportunities.

Once an organisation without an official logo (it borrowed SkillsFuture’s one), the new name and logo reflects LLSG’s expanded mandate as skills become increasingly important in a world bracing for AI-led disruption.

</figure>

LLSG’s brandmark combines two speech bubbles to form a door where they intersect (<a href="https://www.nlb.gov.sg/main/about-us/The-NLB-Brand" target="_blank">looks familiar?</a>), representing its slogan of “opening doors to opportunities”. It also uses Terfens as the official brand typeface, which is a friendly-looking sans serif.

The non-intersecting portions of the speech bubbles in the logo also form frames which are used liberally on LLSG’s content.

<h1>New Logos</h1>
<h2>SkillsFuture Movement</h2>

The SkillsFuture movement unveiled its logo at its 10th anniversary celebration, cementing its status as a key pillar of the social compact under Forward Singapore. Co-led by SkillsFuture Singapore (the statutory board) and Workforce Singapore, the movement supports Singaporeans in developing future-ready skills, and building fulfilling and resilient careers.

<blockquote>
Inspired by the concept of a connector, the logomark symbolises a commitment to integrating learning into all aspects of life. It represents a bridge that connects individuals and enterprises to opportunities, enabling them to level up and achieve their potential.
<br><br>
Additionally, it reflects the partnership between various partners and stakeholders within the ecosystem, working together to support the progress of individuals and enterprises.

<h2>Communicable Diseases Agency</h2>

Established this year as Singapore’s newest statutory board under the Ministry of Health, the Communicable Diseases Agency is Singapore’s public health authority dedicated to safeguarding the nation from communicable diseases through preparation, prevention and protection.

Although no writeup of the logo has been published by CDA, the wordmark suggests protection against and containment of diseases, represented by the red dot.
