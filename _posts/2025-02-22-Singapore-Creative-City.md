<h2>This is a rhetorical question üôÉ</h2>

Singapore is a creative city. 

That is a fact, according to UNESCO's Design Cities project, which inscribed Singapore as a <a href="https://designsingapore.org/about-us/unesco-creative-city-of-design/" target="_blank">City of Design</a> in 2015. Other cities on the list include Shenzhen, Nagoya and Helsinki. 

No doubt, Singapore is famed for impressive and eye-catching architecture, but design extends far beyond that‚Äîthink branding, campaigns, wayfinding‚Äîthe list goes on and on.

Design is an integral part of our lives, yet how much do we actually know about it? Is our collective understanding of design comparable to the people of Japan and Finland? Can the man on the street explain what he likes about a logo beyond saying it "looks nice"?

Significant progress has been made in Singapore‚Äôs design story, yet this has not translated into an increase in everyday design knowledge or appreciation.

This disconnect may be because good‚Äîsome argue the best‚Äîdesign, is invisible. Headlines tend to be written about poor design. 

On the opposite end of the spectrum, the lifestyle section is filled with stories of designer products and luxury experiences which might make it seem like design is only for the wealthy.

The truth is, from the smooth user experience of apps to adorable mascots that make brand messages stick, these are all examples of design. Design is everywhere and meant for everyone. You decide if it is <a href="https://www.designinsingapore.com/artists-non-essential/" target="_blank">essential</a>.

A decade has passed since Singapore was recognised as a City of Design. As we celebrate SG60, it is a good time to look back and see how far we have progressed as a creative city. Our history can also inspire us to flex our creative muscles, whether we work in the field or not. For those looking for practicality, SkillsFuture recently <a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/skillsfuture-skills-report-creative-industry-generative-ai-jobs-4887421" target="_blank">reported</a> that 70 per cent of professionals in ‚Äúnon-creative‚Äù job roles still require creative skills.

Seeing Singapore from a design lens reveals new possibilities for us to appreciate what makes this country unique. Unlocking this perspective has always been this platform‚Äôs mission. No jargon, no intimidation‚Äîjust accessible, engaging content for all.

Welcome to Design In Singapore, your creative escape.
