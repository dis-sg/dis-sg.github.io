More than a year after COVID-19 arrived at our shores, Singapore is still learning how to cope with the disease - in July, a surge in community cases forced a postponement of the National Day Parade to 21st August. 

Let’s take a closer look at the visual identity of Singapore’s belated birthday celebration and look back at some interesting moments of the NDP 2021 campaign. 

<h2>Identity: “Our Singapore Spirit”</h2>

The lion motif is back again, but this time, it is crafted in an abstract way that forms a 56. Inspired by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lion_head_symbol_of_Singapore" target="_blank">Lion Head Symbol</a>, Nanyang Polytechnic student <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3TI4UQSdng" target="_blank">Tan Yun Xin</a> won a nationwide polytechnic competition with this concept which was further developed into the final logo by local design agency <a href="https://blackdesign.world/" target="_blank">BLACK</a>. 

Navigating the curves and strokes to create the motif is no easy feat, and the designers managed to incorporate 56 without making it look awkward. The dent at the “5” to separate the lion’s face from its mane is a masterful example of less is more. 

Another highlight of this logo is how tightly the words fit with the motif, resembling an official seal, stars and all. The placing of the elements also helps to sell the concept of “togetherness”. Unfortunately, this synergy is lost in horizontal mockups.
