Former UK Prime Minister Harold Wilson famously said “a week is a long time in politics”. The stories in this creative weekly are barely 2 weeks old, but seem like they happened ages ago. 

Media outlets have been diligently pumping out election news that I already have enough stories to write the following creative weekly post. Till then, enjoy this recap of what happened in the past 2 weeks.

<h2>Animal Crossing Rallies?</h2>

Animal Crossing, the unofficial coronavirus quarantine game, has a feature which allows you to import images as prints on in-game clothing, tiles and more. Since physical rallies are not allowed this GE, Facebook user <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10213941018318784&set=a.1349110907041" target="_blank">Ng Yi Shu</a> created an island full of political party-branded items to hold Animal Crossing rallies. When the Workers’ Party (WP) shared his post, some speculated if it was going to be a reality.

The truth is WP is simply embracing fan-made content by sharing them, including reposting fancams typically made for K-pop idols. For now, it would be sticking to online rallies on social media.

<h2>Red Dot United’s Logo</h2>
After Red Dot United (RDU) officially became Singapore’s 13th political party (12th after the dissolution of SingFirst), it swiftly unveiled its new logo - a red compass.

While visually memorable, the logo lacks a distinguishing detail which separates it from any random compass graphic on a free icon site. It is simple to a fault. 

RDU’s logo may be bland, but its <a href="https://www.facebook.com/reddotunitedsg/" target="_blank">Facebook</a> posts are anything but that. They are edgy, which might be their interpretation of the best way to engage youths, as stated in their key goals.

RDU’s hashtag for its Jurong GRC campaign, #JurongOrNothing, sounds a bit too aggressive for locals to chew on. I wonder if this hashtag is a subtle nod to its sports club-sounding name.
