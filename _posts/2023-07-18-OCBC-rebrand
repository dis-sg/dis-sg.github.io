OCBC has undergone a brand refresh as the bank looks to conquer the ASEAN-Greater China market with a unified look. The project was led by creative agency <a href="https://thegovt.org/sg/" target="_blank">GOVT</a>, the bank’s partner of close to seven years. 

Among the changes in the brand refresh are a logo that has been tweaked for the digital age, a new tagline and name changes for its key subsidiaries. 

<h2>Logo Tweaks</h2>

The refreshed logo by creative agency <a href="https://www.goodfellas.com.sg/" target="_blank">Goodfellas</a> builds on the strong visual identity that has anchored the brand for 25 years. Here is what the OCBC website says about the new look:

Gaps between the strokes that make up the junk ship on the logomark have been enlarged for clearer viewing on small displays such as phones - think social media profile photos and app icons. Details including the ocean waves have also been removed to achieve a cleaner look.

Most notably, the word “bank” has been dropped from the wordmark, which makes sense as the “B” in “OCBC” already stands for “Banking”. The brand is also recognisable enough to drop the bank labelling.

The wordmark uses a custom geometric typeface called…wait for it…Geomanist. The perfect circle-curviness of the chunky letters allow the wordmark to shine and it pairs well with the logomark.
