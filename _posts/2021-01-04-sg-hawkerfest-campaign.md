The campaign to celebrate Singapore’s successful inscription of hawker culture in UNESCO's Intangible Cultural Heritage List combines two things all Singaporeans love: free stuff and food. 

SG HawkerFest, which runs from 26 December 2020 to 11 January 2021, is mostly an online affair. The main campaign involves completing hawker trivia quizzes on a <a href="https://sghawkerfest.sg/" target="_blank">minisite</a> in exchange for $2 vouchers which can be used in one of the 29 participating hawker centres.

The hawker centres range from old-school legends such as People's Park Food Centre and hawker culture's poster child Tiong Bahru Market to newer additions such as those in Kampung Admiralty and Yishun Park. 

<h2>Aesthetic</h2>
It is commendable that the National Envrionment Agency (NEA) created a publicly-accessible e-resource kit for this campaign. Usually, style guides are only released for crowdsourced art projects when outsiders have to handle the logo. Nonetheless, this is still a welcome change as it gives us an inside look into the thinking behind aesthetic choices. 

The logo’s shape is inspired by old-school hawker signboards. SG HawkerFest is written in all four official languages, and the only graphic in the logo is a typical hawker centre round table and chairs. According to the resource kit, the logo “symbolises a communal gathering point for both hawkers and patrons”, likening hawker centres to community dining rooms.

The style guide establishes the dos-and-don'ts for the logo, along with the colour palette and fonts used - a good refresher on how to create a set of brand guidelines.

The two accompanying illustration sets do the heavy lifting for the identity, which adorns all campaign material. The first set is a panoramic view of a hawker centre by creative studio 8EyedSpud - they recently posted sketches and the full piece on their <a href="https://www.instagram.com/8eyedspud/" target="_blank">Instagram</a> page.

The other set is full of gradients which gives off a regal feel, fitting for a culture which has just gotten elevated and internationally recognised status. (I’m working on finding the illustrator(s) behind this).

Coinciding with this campaign is the #ThankYouHawkers Art Project by the National Heritage Board. Illustrations by four local artists were commissioned and put up as banners at hawker centres.
