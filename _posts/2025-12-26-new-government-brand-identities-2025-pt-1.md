<h2>More than just SG60 🔴</h2>

This year was unsurprisingly busy for the world’s best public administration. With SG60 and several agencies hitting milestone anniversaries, a wave of new brand identities were unveiled, ranging from large-scale revamps to subtle design tweaks.

Here are some of them:

<h1>Anniversary Logos</h1>

<h2>SG60</h2>

Singapore’s diamond jubilee brought several goodies, from SG60 Vouchers to SG Culture Pass credits and the SG60 Baby Gift. Tying these celebratory initiatives together was a single, familiar mark: the SG60 logo, designed by design agency <a href="https://blackdesign.world/project/sg60/" target="_blank">BLACK</a>.

<blockquote>
“The SG60 logo continues the celebration of the little red dot as when it was celebrated during SG50. It brings back the once-familiar symbol for the celebration of Singapore’s 60th birthday.”
<br><br>
-SG60 Brand Guide
</blockquote>

The red dot was never truly absent over the past decade, as it inspired the SG Bicentennial logo and SG brand mark, which now appears on many government posters.

A tweak in this year’s design is the use of the open-source Metropolis typeface instead of the premium font Gotham used in SG50. It may signify inclusivity and the openness for ground-up participation in SG60 activations.

Singaporeans were invited to put their spin on the SG60 logo in a contest held by Mediacorp. Winners had their designs printed on merch…which will be outdated in a few days time.

<h2>SAF60</h2>

The Singapore Armed Forces also celebrated its 60th anniversary this year. The anniversary logo colours the silhouette of Singapore in four distinct colours representing the Singapore Army, Republic of Singapore Navy, Republic of Singapore Air Force, and Digital and Intelligence Service.

<blockquote>
“The SAF60 logo represents the essence of the SAF's history and values throughout its sixty years of service and commitment to national defence, as well as its future aspirations. At the heart of the logo, the letters "SAF" are interconnected, symbolising the interoperability that have made the organisation a formidable fighting force. The prominent "60" stands as a bold testament to six decades of dedicated service, with its thick, continuous brush strokes representing the SAF's tenacity and ongoing transformation.
<br><br>
The forward-angling of these colour elements signifies the SAF's progressive and future-oriented outlook. Incorporating national symbols, the logo features the red colour, crescent moon, and five stars of Singapore's flag. These elements serve as a powerful reminder of the nation's enduring spirit and the SAF's role in preserving it. The backdrop, a stylised silhouette of Singapore, acts as a vivid reminder of the SAF’s duty: to protect Singapore’s sovereignty, security, and way of life.”

<h1>Rebrands</h1>

<h2>National Library Board</h2>

By embracing digitalisation early, NLB said it has bucked the trend of declining visitorship plaguing other libraries globally. This push towards technology is most clearly expressed in its rebrand, where it extracted the “pages and pixels” from its original book logo to become an abstract brandmark reflecting “a portal of discovery”. 

<figure>

</figure>

<blockquote>
“Our brandmark inspires multiple interpretations. The three coloured panels represent a dynamic portal of discovery and a gateway to new horizons. The interplay of red and orange frames surrounding the blue portal creates multiple perspectives, shaping the viewer’s perspectives.
<br><br>
The typography of the logotype uses Fira Sans, a font with rounded edges to align with the brandmark, for a functional yet approachable style. The logotype is in lowercase to invite everyone to engage with NLB as a portal for continuous discovery and opportunities.”
<br><br>
-NLB Brand page
</blockquote>

The rebrand caused quite a stir online, with some questioning if NLB was going to deprioritise books. Criticism aside, the logo signals NLB’s ambition to stay relevant in the digital age. 

This year was also NLB’s 30th anniversary, and it partnered with local heritage design label <a href="https://www.instagram.com/triologie_emporium/" target="_blank">Triologie</a> to launch a capsule collection featuring the new logo.

<h2>National Archives of Singapore</h2>

As part of NLB, the National Archives also refreshed its logo to align with the parent brand,  notably removing its book motif in the process.


<blockquote>
“The refreshed National Archives of Singapore's (NAS) logo draws inspiration from the design of the NLB brand. It reflects NAS is part of NLB, while maintaining its unique identity as a memory institution for Singapore and a custodian of archival materials of national and historical significance collected and preserved by the NAS.
<br><br>
The application of green in the logo shows NAS's heritage and provides a link to the past, while referencing sustainability as a guiding principle for NAS in collecting and preserving archival materials. Adopting the elements of the NLB's branding, NAS shares NLB's vision to inspire discovery and encourage curiosity in Singapore's stories, past, present and future.

<h2>Accountant-General’s Department</h2>

AGD quietly rebranded in July, without even a social post to announce the logo change. The new logo uses a sans serif font with a bespoke “A” and “D”.

<h2>Competition and Consumer Commission of Singapore</h2>

For its 20th anniversary, CCS (formerly known as CCCS) underwent an extensive rebranding exercise which included an acronym and logo change, to “signal its commitment to fostering well-functioning markets in an increasingly complex global landscape”.

<blockquote>
Our rebrand to “CCS” reflects our confidence in new beginnings – signalling growth, maturity and renewed clarity of purpose. Our dynamic logo symbolises thriving markets in motion, blending golden-yellow energy with the authoritative blue of a strong and reliable regulator, rooted in our institutional legacy. Together, these elements position CCS as both today's guardian of fairness and innovation and, tomorrow's future-ready regulator.
