2020 continues to be a year of firsts as we celebrate our nation’s 55th birthday without a traditional National Day Parade (NDP). This year, we did not get an opportunity to grumble about how NDP ticket balloting is rigged, or get envious of NDP attendees who received funpacks. Instead, this NDP is about emerging stronger from the coronavirus crisis, as reflected in this year’s NDP branding. 

<h2>Logo</h2>

> “The NDP2020 logo captures the dualities of compassion and conviction. The heart represents Compassion, a heart for the nation, a heart for one another, a fellow Singaporean. The fist signifies Conviction, pledging as one united people to build a better future together. The red-purple colour gradient shows us transiting with optimism and passion into an inspiring future.” <cite>— <a href="https://www.ndp.gov.sg/about/theme-and-logo/" target="_blank">NDP Website</a></cite>

The graphic elements used in this logo are not new. In fact, hearts, hands and the canton are among the most <a href="https://dis-sg.github.io/NDP-Logos-sorted-1/" target="_blank">commonly used elements</a> seen in NDP logos. However, positioning of the hand as a fist is a first. Such an aggressive (at least by NDP logo standards) pose would look out of place for a celebratory event, but this year, clenched fists take on the meaning of perseverance, not rebellion.

The geometric, bolded typeface encapsulates the idea of “togetherness”. Furthermore, the curved edges of the logo complements the rounded typeface well, creating a visually-pleasing effect. 

At first glance, the red-purple gradient resembles a toned-down version of Instagram’s colour palette. Looking at the brand applications, it becomes clear that this is where the similarities end. The colour palette is smooth and futuristic, unlike the messy rainbow-coloured gradients of the 2000s.

<h2>Applications</h2>

To reflect the unique ‘NDP from home’ experience, NDP’s Facebook cover photo placed an emphasis on heartland celebrations, with residential blocks placed front and centre instead of Marina Bay landmarks. I cannot unsee the gradient ‘shooting stars’ as a meteor shower though.

Curves and rounded edges extend beyond the logo to form a core part of the visual identity, which make applications appear friendly and inviting.
