<h2>NS ‘Square’</h2>

PM Lee unveiled the design of NS Square during his annual <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tK_S3qmvhcE" target="_blank">National Day Message</a>. The development, which would replace the existing Marina Bay Floating Platform, was designed by architectural firm WOHA, of Parkroyal at Pickering fame.

The most striking feature of NS Square is the circular stage design, in defiance of mathematical theory. The default stage design features a gigantic SG brand logo, leaning deeper into the Red Dot nickname which was once intended to be an insult.

PM Lee said it would be aligned on a central axis, which is “cheem” designer talk that its presence in Marina Bay would be balanced by The Promontory on the opposite side of the bay.

NS Square would not just be an events location. Behind the curved seating gallery is a water sports facility for canoeists and kayakers, plus a swimming pool to boot.

With many non-military purposes of NS Square, its name seems off-brand. Sure, a permanent NS-themed gallery would be built to showcase Singapore’s conscription policy, but I cannot think of a steady visitor stream other than those on school excursions or government agency cohesion events.  

At least rename ‘Square’ to something which reflects its curvy appearance.

Construction work is slated to begin in early 2022. In the meantime, should we give the underutilised Singapore Sports Hub another shot at hosting the NDP?

<h2>Gallery and Co leaves a trail of debt to small businesses</h2>

Gallery and Co operator ByandCo <a href="https://www.facebook.com/GalleryandCo/photos/a.867898853294109/3139640229453282/" target="_blank">announced</a> on August 6 that the store is now under liquidation. It is another significant blow to the local design sector, after the news of Naiise pulling out of running Design Orchard’s retail showcase just last month. 

Unlike the Naiise-Design Orchard collaboration which ended amicably, Gallery and Co is alleged to have blindsided its suppliers.

The Little Dröm Store said in a statement on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/thelittledromstore/posts/4134952633212549" target="_blank">Facebook</a> that communication with the firm was poor in recent months, resulting in an outstanding payment of $12,000 from sales since November 2019. It added that about $30,000 worth of products still remain in the store.
