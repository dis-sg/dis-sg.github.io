Time to vote! This GE has been far from civil, but hopefully this creative weekly would help you take your mind off politics for a while and appreciate the creativity which goes into making campaigns work (or not). Try to savour the moment, this only happens twice a decade. 

<i>This is the second GE2020 edition of creative weekly. The first one can be found <a href="https://dis-sg.github.io/creative-weekly-3/" target="_blank">here</a>.</i>
