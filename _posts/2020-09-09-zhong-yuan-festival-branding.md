The annual Hungry Ghost (also known as Zhong Yuan) Festival is a month-long spectacle of sights and sounds, but in light of social distancing regulations this year, many activities have pivoted online. 

Recognising that this Zhong Yuan Festival would be noticeably quieter, creatives and heritage businesses joined forces to launch <a href="https://tmmw.sg/" target="_blank">zhongyuanfestival.sg</a>, an interactive site which seeks to replicate the physical festival atmosphere and document the age-old festival practices which may soon be lost to time. 

The project was done by creative studios <a href="https://tmmw.sg/" target="_blank">The Merry Men Works</a> and <a href="https://weconvey.co/" target="_blank">Convey</a>, together with web design studio Screensavers.

The chinese characters for Zhong Yuan (中元) stacked on top of each other form the festival’s logo. The logo comes in two colour palettes - yellow on dark blue and yellow on red - both reminiscent of 7-month paraphernalia.
