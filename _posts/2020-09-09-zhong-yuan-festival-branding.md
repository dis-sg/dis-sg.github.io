The annual Hungry Ghost (also known as Zhong Yuan) Festival is a month-long spectacle of sights and sounds, but in light of social distancing regulations this year, many activities have pivoted online. 

Recognising that this Zhong Yuan Festival would be noticeably quieter, creatives and heritage businesses joined forces to launch <a href="https://zhongyuanfestival.sg/" target="_blank">zhongyuanfestival.sg</a>, an interactive site which seeks to replicate the physical festival atmosphere and document the age-old festival practices which may soon be lost to time. 

The project was done by creative studios <a href="https://tmmw.sg/" target="_blank">The Merry Men Works</a> and <a href="https://weconvey.co/" target="_blank">Convey</a>, together with web design studio Screensavers.

<h2>Identity</h2>

The chinese characters for Zhong Yuan (中元) stacked on top of each other form the festival’s logo. The logo comes in two colour palettes - yellow on dark blue and yellow on red - both reminiscent of 7-month paraphernalia.

Colourful GIFs and old-school gradients adorn the site, complete with a textured background inspired by hell notes. The hand-drawn aesthetic of the brand elements by illustrator Patrick Tan reflects the organic spirit of Zhong Yuan Festival: traditional and made with love.

Getai Grotesk, the typeface used for the identity, was created by <a href="https://getaikitsch.com/" target="_blank">Slyvester Tan</a> when he embarked on his own journey of documenting getai’s kitsch aesthetic. The typeface along with a set of digitised <a href="https://getaikitsch.com/Graphic-Library" target="_blank">deconstructed getai graphics</a> are open source, if you are interested in creating art for tech-savvy hungry ghosts. 

<h2>Applications</h2>
Zhong Yuan Festival’s social media channels showcase a more minimalist side of the event identity. Gradients and money design patterns take centrestage of posts which include public service announcements and festival trivia.

My favourite graphic is the row of chairs which represent the front row seats of getai events, deliberately left empty as they are reserved for the spirits’ use.

<h2>Activities</h2> 
The site highlights four main activities which form the essence of Zhong Yuan Festival: auction dinners, Getai, Chinese Street Opera and the burning of kim zua (paper effigies of material goods).
