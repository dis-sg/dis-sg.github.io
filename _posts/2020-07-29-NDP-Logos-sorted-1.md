The tradition of having a logo represent a National Day Parade (NDP) first began in 1998. Each logo has a complementary identity system which helps to brand parade paraphernalia and props. 

With NDP 2020, 23 logos have been created to celebrate Singapore's birthday. Graphical similarities start to appear when you examine all 23 logos, which could be classified into three broad categories: flag, people and geography.

<h2>Flag Category</h2>
This category consists of NDP logos with graphical elements of the Singapore flag, which include the crescent moon and five stars. 

The crescent moon represents a young nation on the ascendant, while the five stars represent Singapore's ideals of democracy, peace, progress, justice and equality.

<h3>Logos with the Canton</h3>

The canton of the flag refers to the upper-left portion of the flag. Similar to the flags of Malaysia and Taiwan, the most recognisable graphic of Singapore’s flag lies in the canton. 

Seven NDP logos feature the canton, where the crescent moon and five stars are arranged in the same way as in the flag. Most of these cantons were designed to be in motion to simulate a waving flag.
