Creative workshop and gallery STPI is holding its annual open house this week. Titled <i>Font Memories</i>, visitors can take part in over 10 activities of different printing techniques guided by STPI artists and volunteers.

Admission is free but donations are welcomed - blank tote bags and notebooks are available at the registration counter for purchase so you can handprint a design on them.
