Creative workshop and gallery STPI is holding its annual open house this week. Titled <i>Font Memories</i>, visitors can take part in over 10 activities of different printing techniques guided by STPI artists and volunteers.

Admission is free but donations are welcomed - blank tote bags and notebooks are available at the registration counter for purchase so you can handprint a design on them.

Font Memories’ colourful identity celebrates different typography and printing terms, from Aquatint to Z-fold. Many of these printing methods, including aquatint, are available for visitors to experience during the open house.

The modular aesthetic allows for neat applications, keeping the rainbow of colours in check from overshadowing the actual content.

Each visitor is given a stamp card to track the progress of completed activities which doubles as a cute memento, but the real souvenirs are printed creations of the activities. 

<b2>Activities</b2>
In “Print with the Pros”, visitors can try relief printing, lithography, screenprinting, and more. STPI artists will guide you though the different printing processes and explain the nuances that go into creating a good printed - and uniquely handmade - creation.
