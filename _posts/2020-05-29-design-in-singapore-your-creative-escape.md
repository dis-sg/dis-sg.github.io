Hello Singapore!

Welcome to Design In Singapore (DIS), an exploration of local culture through the lens of design. 

As Singaporean designers continue to break new ground in their various fields, there is a growing need for a design-centric media platform. DIS strives to record history in the making and serve as a platform for celebrating good design, while demystifying the design process. (More on DIS' goals <a href="https://dis-sg.github.io/sg/about">here</a>.) 

This journey started in 2017 when I created <a href="https://brandingsingapore.blogspot.com/">Branding Singapore</a> to share my views on local visual identities. 50 posts later, I found myself itching to write about other types of design, such as advertising campaigns and user experiences.

As the name suggests, DIS aims to cover as many design fields as possible. This can only succeed through collaborations, which I am looking forward to.



Your Creative Escape.
