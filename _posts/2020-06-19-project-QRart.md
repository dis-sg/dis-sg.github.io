Scanning QR codes have become part and parcel of daily life. Even as restrictions ease, visitors to public places are still expected to check in and out via the SafeEntry web app. As queues start to return in Phase 2, there is an incentive for businesses to replace low fidelity QR code posters with more interesting ones. 

This is how most SafeEntry QR code posters look like. Many are loud and fierce, which does the job but can get very boring, especially when they are devoid of colour.
