Scanning QR codes have become part and parcel of daily life. Even as restrictions ease, visitors to public places are still expected to check in and out via the SafeEntry web app. As queues start to return in Phase 2, there is an incentive for businesses to replace low fidelity QR code posters with more interesting ones. 

Currently, most SafeEntry QR code posters look loud, fierce and are devoid of colour. They get the job done and are easily forgettable.

<a href="https://www.instagram.com/gof_y/">GOFY</a>, a home-grown creative community which celebrates Southeast Asian art, wants to change this. Their latest project, <a href="https://www.projectqrart.com/">#QRart</a>, seeks to make QR scanning less of a chore and more of a visually delightful experience through illustrated posters.

The posters range from cute to inspiring, lifting our spirits as we adjust to the ‘new normal’.

All posters feature a short artist introduction and links to their portfolio.

There is much potential for this project to beautify our neighbourhoods. At the same printing cost, businesses can transform a mundane task into a fun and memorable one. These are the little things which make businesses stand out, while simultaneously supporting the arts scene.  

So far, 12 available posters by 8 artists have been <a href="https://www.projectqrart.com/>uploaded</a>. Simply download a poster and insert the QR code into the template before printing. 

If you would like to contribute to the collection, email lionelrichie@gof---y.com.
