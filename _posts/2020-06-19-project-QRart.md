Scanning QR codes have become part and parcel of daily life. Even as restrictions ease, visitors to public places are still expected to check in and out via the SafeEntry web app. As queues start to return in Phase 2, there is an incentive for businesses to replace low fidelity QR code posters with more interesting ones. 

Currently, most SafeEntry QR code posters look loud, fierce and are devoid of colour. They get the job done but are easily forgettable.

<a href="https://www.instagram.com/gof_y/">GOFY</a>, a home-grown creative community which celebrates Southeast Asian art, wants to change this. Their latest project, <a href="https://www.projectqrart.com/">#QRart</a>, seeks to make QR scanning less of a chore and more of a visually delightful experience through illustrated posters.

The posters range from cute to inspiring, lifting our spirits as we adjust to the ‘new normal’.

The process is fairly simple: just download a poster and insert your QR code before printing it. 

There is much potential for this project to beautify our neighbourhoods. At the same printing cost, businesses can transform a mundane task into a fun and memorable one. It is one of those little things which make businesses stand out, which could go a long way in building brand equity. Artists also benefit, as each poster contains a short artist introduction and a link to their portfolio. 

Over 12 posters by 9 artists have been <a href="https://www.projectqrart.com/">uploaded</a> to #QRart, and the collection continues to grow each day. If you would like to contribute your art, email lionelrichie@gof---y.com.

Let this project be a testament to local creativity in adversity.
