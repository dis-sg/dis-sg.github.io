Scanning QR codes have become part and parcel of daily life. Even as restrictions ease, visitors to public places are still expected to check in and out via the SafeEntry web app. As queues start to return in Phase 2, there is an incentive for businesses to replace low fidelity QR code posters with more interesting ones. 

This is how most SafeEntry QR code posters look like. Many are loud and fierce, which does the job but can get very boring, especially when they are devoid of colour.

<a href="https://www.instagram.com/gof_y/">GOFY</a> is a home-grown creative community which celebrates Southeast Asian art. Their latest project, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/gof_y/">#QRart</a>, seeks to make QR scanning less of a chore and more of a visually delightful experience through illustrated posters.

The posters range from cute to inspiring, lifting our spirits as we adjust to the ‘new normal’.

All posters feature a short artist introduction and links to their portfolio.

There is much potential for this project to beautify our neighbourhoods. At the same printing cost, businesses can transform a mundane experience into a fun and memorable one. These are the little things which make businesses stand out, while simultaneously supporting the arts scene.  

Currently, there are 12 available posters created by 8 artists. Simply download a poster and insert the QR code into the template before printing. 

GOFY is also accepting more artwork. If you would like to contribute to the collection, email lionelrichie@gof---y.com
