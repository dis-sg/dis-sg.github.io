<h2>The new name is an own goal ⚽</h2>

Renaming landmarks is a tricky affair. Competitions were held and consultants were hired to find better names for the Budget Terminal or Marina Bay, only for the respective management teams to stick with the original names. Why bother with rebranding in the first place? 

The Kallang Group (formerly known as Kallang Alive Sports Management) has the answer—the same answer that every management has when they attempt to rebrand—evolution, expansion, and growth.

Netizens can get behind the vision of making a world-class events venue better, but not the new name “The Kallang”. Some criticised it for being too basic, devoid of originality, or overly pretentious, like how condos tend to start their names with “The” or “Le (french for the)”.

Singapore Sports Hub was an imperfect name. Many Southeast Asians know this venue as Taylor Swift’s and Lady Gaga’s only SEA tour stop. The venue was always intended to host more than sporting events. Remember how it was supposed to be the new home for the National Day Parade? 

Kallang is an integral part of Singapore’s sporting history, and The Kallang Group was smart to include the location in the new name. This was what they said:

<blockquote>

“In Singapore, “Kallang” represents more than a name or location. It is a powerful yet emotional symbol of national pride. Rooted in Singapore’s collective consciousness, “Kallang” has always represented a space where people unite through competitions, celebrations and shared experiences like the National Day Parade.

“Kallang” has been home to both the previous and current National Stadium, hosting countless memorable moments that united the nation. It is where the legendary “Kallang Roar” and “Kallang Wave” emerged as fans rallied behind Team Singapore, transforming individual voices into a powerful chorus of national pride.

This rich sporting legacy forms the foundation upon which The Kallang now builds. The transition from Singapore Sports Hub to The Kallang represents our evolution – where we broaden our identity while honouring our sporting heritage. It embraces our collective memories while strengthening our belief that sport, entertainment, lifestyle and community form the pillars of a dynamic ecosystem.”

-The Kallang Group Media Release

</blockquote>

But slapping “the” in front of it feels anticlimactic and does not capture the soul of our sporting culture—unlike the Kallang Roar and Kallang Wave, which are iconic and organic fan expressions in support of Team Singapore. 

The beautifully named Kallang Wave Mall was thankfully unaffected by the muddled rebranding, which leaves Kallang Roar as an unused name option. It may sound a bit cheesy, but definitely less awkward than <i>~The~</i> Kallang.

<h2>Logo: K</h2>

Singapore Sports Hub’s logo featured 7 human-like figures with their arms lifted, resembling a crowd cheering à la the Kallang Wave. The multiple colours could be a nod to the many uses of the venue or the Olympic colours. A bit dated, sure, but it served its purpose of representing an events venue.

10 years later, the figures have retired to make way for a bespoke “K”, made up of 4 shapes pointing towards the centre of the letter. It seems to imply that Kallang is THE place to be. 

The new logo tries to capture the dynamism of the old one by extending the right ends of the “K”, but it may be more subtle than intended. Also, not setting fixed curvatures of the ends is a microaggression to designers.

The key visuals for The Kallang use warped typography to make them pop, and they do so nicely. The irony is that The Kallang Group got rid of “Alive” from their name only for the word to feature heavily in its banners.

<H2>Sports is where brands conquer</h2>

Sports and sports-adjacent industries should know best that brands matter a lot to fans—from the teams they support to athlete jerseys plastered with sponsor logos. 

For The Kallang to miss the mark on this rebrand is quite remarkable. The Internet had a field day with this announcement, but behind the jokes was a sense that this was a missed opportunity to appropriately honour Singapore’s sporting heritage. 

Maybe they will get it right a decade later. What should we call hope?

Goal 2034. Duh.
