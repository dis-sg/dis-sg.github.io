The threat of rising sea levels is real, but instead of presenting a gloomy future which is the prevailing media narrative, AR and VR studio <a href="https://www.meshminds.com/" target="_blank">MeshMinds</a> imagines how cities might adapt by becoming floating utopias.

Held at the ArtScience Museum until 30 September, MeshMinds 3.0: ArtxTechforGood is a free showcase of interactive and immersive experiences by Asian creatives on the theme of sustainability and cultural heritage protection. 

The highlight of this showcase is a 20-minute VR experience that transports viewers to Aquasia and Neo-Santara, two radically different realities that only share an asian-influenced aesthetic. This is my review of the experience. 

<h2>Entering the Virtual Universe</h2>
Upon entering the VR hall, the first thing that caught my eye was the huge Aquasia logo beamed on the wall, in big brother fashion. Participants donning VR goggles were seated on swivel chairs but most of them were still - only a handful tilted their heads occasionally.

Helpful ArtScience Museum staff briefed us on what to expect before we were guided to our VR sets, which could be tightened or loosened according to one’s head shape.

<h2>Aquasia</h2>
Before touring Aquasia proper, the narrator shared some alarming facts, including an estimated 70% of those directly affected by rising sea levels will be from eight Asian countries. Humans are not the type to simply give up, so Aquasia was conceived as a potential way for mankind to survive without land.

The scene then changed to a vast seascape with a futuristic-looking city on the horizon. Welcome to Aquasia. 

Not only is the city self-sufficient, farming work is fully automated and crops have the ability to grow 24/7, eliminating the limitations of seasons and weather changes. Aquasia is also carbon-negative, meaning it removes more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere than it produces. Basically, the city is described as a wet dream for climate and energy scientists. Whether or not the science is valid is a different story.

I felt like I was observing the floating city from the perspective of a drone - one moment I was on sea level and the next I was floating on top of the futuristic structures. The whole viewing experience also felt a bit like a property or masterplan video, as the narrator took me through the various technologies that make Aquasia the utopia that it is. What number do I call to invest?

The panoramic views of the city were carefully selected to view the architectural design in all its glory. Best described as futuristic aesthetics with an Eastern touch, the modular city relies heavily on floating bridges that connect to the lotus-shaped metallic/glass structure in the centre of the city. 

The latter half of the Aquasia tour was inside the lotus structure, which housed the six winning works of Julius Baer Next Generation Art Prize. The digital art ranged from the elaborate to the abstract, on the themes of Future Cities, Digital Disruption and Sustainability. Repping Singapore are André Wee, Chan Wan Kyn and Jamela Law.
