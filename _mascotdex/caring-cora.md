In 2016, as part of the Sustainable Singapore Movement by the Ministry of the Environment and Water Resources in Singapore (now Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment), five mascots were introduced to encourage citizens to adopt more sustainable lifestyles. Each mascot was designed to personify various pillars of the Sustainable Singapore Blueprint, and they were collectively known as the Sustainable Singapore Blueprint Friends.

Caring Cora is a heart mascot who represents Singapore’s goal as a leading green economy. A social media <a href="https://www.facebook.com/MSEsingapore/videos/1349955621722323/" target="_blank">post</a> by the Ministry explains her story: 

<blockquote>“Caring Cora is a great role model for an active and gracious community. She loves to volunteer in all kinds of community events that will help create a greener and more sustainable Singapore. Her warmth and friendly demeanor are what attracts others in her community to work together in helping each other make a brighter future for everyone.”</blockquote>

Together with Smiley Ray, Caring Cora, Smart Eddie and Eco Eva, they form a silhouette of Singapore, which is used as the logo for the Sustainable Singapore Blueprint and the Sustainable Singapore Gallery (SSB) at Marina Barrage.

In 2021, the Sustainable Singapore Blueprint was succeeded by the SG Green Plan 2030. Although the five mascots are no longer actively used in the Ministry’s outreach efforts, they are still featured in SSB’s logo, while life-sized figures of the mascots continue to welcome visitors to the gallery.
