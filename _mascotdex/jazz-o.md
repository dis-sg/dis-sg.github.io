Jazz-O, the official mascot for the Sing Singapore campaign, was introduced in 1988 as part of efforts to promote community singing and national pride in Singapore. Dressed in a conductorâ€™s suit complete with a baton, the lion appeared at concerts, school events, National Day celebrations, and even on company grounds to conduct mass singing sessions.
