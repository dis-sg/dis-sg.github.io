Champ was a terrapin mascot of the Singapore Blood Transfusion Service (SBTS), typically portrayed standing with a wide smile and wearing red and blue shoes.

In celebration of Champâ€™s <a href="https://www.moh.gov.sg/newsroom/1st-anniversary-of-singapore-blood-transfusion-service%27s-mascot-champ " target="_blank">first birthday</a>, a pewter bookmark was given to all who successfully donated blood at the National Blood Centre in June 1999, in a joint effort by Royal Selangor and SBTS.

The Singapore Red Cross has since replaced the Singapore Blood Transfusion Service as the national blood donor recruiter, retiring the mascot.
