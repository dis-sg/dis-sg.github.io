Sher is a female lion cub introduced by the Singapore Kindness Movement as part of the friend group of Singa known as the Kindness Cubbies. The group promotes kindness, empathy, and positive social behaviour through newsletters, games, and the animated series The Adventures of Singa and the Kindness Cubbies. Collectively, these activities and media are known as Kindsville, the initiative of the movement which focuses on children outreach.

The Kindsville website provides a write-up about Sher:

“Sher is a sweet and caring Kindness Cubbie who is a natural daydreamer. She is constantly fantasizing about romantic escapades, usually full of daisy-filled meadows and pretty frocks. As a newest member of the group, Sher grew up in another city and only recently moved to Kindsville. She was welcomed into the Kindness Cubbies clique and is now best of friends with Kalle!”
