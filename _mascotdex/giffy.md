Giffy is the mascot for the Dementia-Friendly Singapore (DFSG) initiative. Unveiled in 2019, the giraffe was chosen for traits that resonate with the goals of the initiative: giraffes are social animals with long necks that allow them to look out for one another, symbolising vigilance and community support. This reflects the DFSG's aim to foster a caring and inclusive society where individuals look out for persons living with dementia.

Designed in an abstract geometric pattern, Giffy stands on its hind legs and is often depicted carrying a large heart. 

Giffy plays a central role in public engagement and education efforts, guiding visitors through exhibitions and serving as a friendly ambassador to raise awareness about dementia. For instance, at the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/story.php/?story_fbid=671418318488401&id=100068607152241&_rdr" target="_blank">#DementiaFriendlySG Exhibition</a>, Giffy leads attendees through various themes related to understanding and supporting those affected by dementia.

Giffy also has a strong social media presence - the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/heygiffy/" target="_blank">Instagram page </a> of DFSG is named after the mascot (note: the page was retired in early 2025). Content on DFSGâ€™s channels include dispelling myths about dementia and tips on how to support dementia patients.
