Trashemon is a mascot of the Public Hygiene Council’s (PHC) Keep Singapore Clean campaign. Introduced alongside <a href="https://designinsingapore.com/mascotdex/toilemon" target="_blank">Toilemon</a> and <a href="https://designinsingapore.com/mascotdex/trayremon" target="_blank">Trayremon</a>, the KeepSGClean Supermons (as they are collectively known) encourage Singaporeans to uphold higher standards of hygiene and cleanliness in their everyday lives.

Trashemon’s design is inspired by Singapore’s green rubbish bins. He has one eye and two horns that rise from the top of his bin body. He speaks from his bin mouth, which is lined with teeth.

Besides being featured on PHC’s social media channels, the council collaborated with the tertiary institutions to create KeepSGClean Supermons content, from animated videos in partnership with Nanyang Polytechnic in 2024 to a <a href="https://www.publichygienecouncil.sg/initiatives/story-writing-competition/" target="_blank">story writing competition</a> in partnership with Temasek Polytechnic.
