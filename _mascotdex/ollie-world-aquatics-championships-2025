Ollie (not to be confused with GovTech’s <a href="https://www.designinsingapore.com/mascotdex/ollie/" target="_blank">Ollie</a>) is an otter mascot of the 22nd World Aquatics Championships 2025, held in Singapore. Ollie, together with fellow mascot <a href="https://www.designinsingapore.com/mascotdex/dewey" target="_blank">Dewey the Dugong</a>, were introduced at a press event 100 days from the start of the championship.

The championship’s website shares more about Ollie in a write-up:

“Cheeky and cheerful, Ollie the urban otter has found a special home in Singapore - not just in the waterways, but also in the hearts of its people! Often seen cruising through the waters of our Garden City or playfully traversing Singapore’s bustling streets, Ollie is a familiar and beloved sight. An excellent swimmer, Ollie’s smooth, fur-covered body sleekly glides through the water before popping up with a friendly wave for fans on land. Ollie is the embodiment of ‘water alongside land’ and ‘nature alongside civilisation'.”
