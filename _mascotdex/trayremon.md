Trayremon is a mascot of the Public Hygiene Council’s (PHC) Keep Singapore Clean campaign. Introduced alongside <a href="https://designinsingapore.com/mascotdex/trashemon" target="_blank">Trashemon</a> and <a href="https://designinsingapore.com/mascotdex/toilemon" target="_blank">Toilemon</a>, the KeepSGClean Supermons (as they are collectively known) encourage Singaporeans to uphold higher standards of hygiene and cleanliness in their everyday lives.

Trayremon has three eyes on a tray-shaped head and purple and pink hair. Her outfit follows the same colourful palette. 

Besides being featured on PHC’s social media channels, the council collaborated with the tertiary institutions to create KeepSGClean Supermons content, from animated videos in partnership with Nanyang Polytechnic in 2024 to a <a href="https://www.publichygienecouncil.sg/initiatives/story-writing-competition/" target="_blank">story writing competition</a> in partnership with Temasek Polytechnic.
