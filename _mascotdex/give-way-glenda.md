Give-Way Glenda is one of five mascots from the Thoughtful Bunch, introduced in 2014 by the Land Transport Authority (LTA) to promote considerate behaviour on Singapore‚Äôs public transport system. Give-Way Glenda promotes queuing on one side of the door and letting others alight first.

The Thoughtful Bunch was born from a 2013 LTA study on commuter behaviour, which sought to improve the travel experience not through rules, but by nudging behaviour with a friendlier tone instead of using ‚Äúpreachy government speak.‚Äù Since then, campaigns featuring the mascots have contributed to an improved Graciousness Behaviour Index, with the Thoughtful Bunch becoming among the most recognisable mascots in Singapore.

Over the past decade, the mascots have appeared in a range of collaborations, especially with food and beverage brands. In 2017 and 2018, Ya Kun Kaya Toast released limited edition coffee cups featuring the characters. In 2019, a partnership with Peel Fresh saw them on tote bags encouraging commuters to ‚Äústart the day fresh with graciousness.‚Äù

The trend continued in 2023, when Burger King sold sundaes in cup sleeves printed with the mascots. In 2024, LTA collaborated with BreadTalk to launch the Thoughtful BreadTalk collection, featuring pastries inspired by each mascot.

Beyond food tie-ins, the Thoughtful Bunch has also reached younger audiences. A 2016 kids' look-alike contest brought the mascots to life, while a 2019 collaboration with Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts (NAFA) gave them fashionable new outfits designed by students.
