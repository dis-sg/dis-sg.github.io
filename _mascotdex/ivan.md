Ivan is the official mascot of Singpass, Singapore’s national digital identity system. Introduced in 2021 alongside the rebrand of the system, Ivan is designed to be the “Clippy of Singpass”, appearing throughout the Singpass app conducting actions such as checking documents and mail. His design is a minimalist humanoid “i” with a red cap that obscures his eyes. He also has circles for arms.
