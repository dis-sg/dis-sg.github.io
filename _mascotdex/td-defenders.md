TD Defenders were a group of five superheroes introduced as part of the Total Defence campaign of 2016. The blocky figures each had its own colour which represented a pillar of Total Defence: Military Defence, Civil Defence, Economic Defence, Social Defence and Psychological Defence.

The TD Defenders were featured on social media and as a paper craft activity at the Singapore Discovery Centre.
