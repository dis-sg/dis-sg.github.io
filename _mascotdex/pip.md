PIP is the mascot of Esplanade – Theatres on the Bay in Singapore, introduced in 2016 to engage young audiences and families. The name "PIP" stands for Playful, Imaginative, and Polite, reflecting the mascot's core values. PIP is depicted as a colourful, round creature who encourages children to learn through play and to think creatively. 

To provide a dedicated space for children and families, Esplanade established PIP's PLAYbox on Level 4. This area features a cozy loft, an arts and crafts section, and a reading corner, all designed to foster creativity and learning in a playful environment.

PIP frequently makes appearances at Esplanade's events, such as the annual Octoburst! Children's Festival, where children have the opportunity to meet and interact with the mascot. Online, families can follow PIP’s Trail, a free digital trail to explore Esplanade through games and puzzles.
