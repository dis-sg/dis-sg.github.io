Captain V was introduced in 1985 by the Singapore Police Force as a mascot for the National Crime Prevention Council. His mission was to educate young teens on crime prevention and encourage their participation in combating crime. The 'V' in his name stood for Vigilance, Valour, Victory, and Volunteer.

At his launch, a 3.65m-tall model of Captain V stood atop a bus, which dramatically crashed through a paper wall at the Police Academy on Thomson Road, unveiling the mascot to the public. 

The part-human, part-android was featured prominently in crime prevention exhibitions and visited neighbourhoods and schools to promote safety messages. 

In 1987, Captain V Productions, led by volunteer constabulary officer Siva Choy, introduced Singapore's first full-colour comic book, <a href="https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/digitised/article/straitstimes19871212-1.2.74.2 " target="_blank">The Amazing Adventures of Captain V</a>, at Comicon. The series followed Captain V as he fought against the villainous Dr D Evil in neighbourhoods like Bukit Timah and Kallang. While the Police did not participate in the comic's creation, they retained the rights to the character.
