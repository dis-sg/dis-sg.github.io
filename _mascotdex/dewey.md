Dewey is an otter mascot of the 22nd World Aquatics Championships 2025, held in Singapore. Dewey, together with fellow mascot <a href="https://www.designinsingapore.com/mascotdex/ollie-world-aquatics-championships-2025/" target="_blank">Ollie the Otter</a>, were introduced at a press event 100 days from the start of the championship.

The championship’s website shares more about Dewey in a write-up:

“Dewey the dugong is a gentle marine mammal native to Singapore’s coastal waters. When it comes to style and grace, few can compete with Dewey in the water. Grazing the warm waters of coastal Singapore, Dewey deftly manoeuvres the strongest currents with its strength and rigour. As one of Singapore’s vulnerable natural sea wonders, Dewey is rather elusive. So if you see the friendly Dewey, make sure to say hi and work together to raise environmental awareness and protect the nation’s marine ecosystems!”
