Captain Green is a mascot of the National Environment Agency (NEA). The frog mascot was introduced in 1990 during the inaugural Clean & Green Week to “raise social responsibilities and heighten environmental awareness on issues such as clean air, nature preservation, recycling, green consumerism and maintaining a litter-free environment".

<h3>Origin Story</h3>

NEA provided a write-up of Captain Green's origin story:

Originally known in his younger days as Mr Green, this is a frog like no other. Being a frog makes him sensitive to his environment, but rather than languishing in his pond like the other frogs, he is an outgoing adventure-seeker.

On one of his explorations, he stumbled upon a sight that made him croak with alarm. A once-clean pond was choked with plastic bottles, wrappers, cardboard, and other rubbish. His heart sank. He knew he had to do something and he had to act fast! Without hesitation, he began to pick up the trash, piece by piece, to save the pond and animals living in it. As Mr Green trudged about in the water under the hot sun, a crowd slowly gathered around him. Deeply moved by his selfless act, the crowd joined in one after another to pick up the trash. Very quickly, the pond was in pristine condition once again.

Seeing how he took the lead to clear the public space of trash, he became affectionately known as “Captain Green” - the eco-warrior frog who rolls up his sleeves to keep Singapore clean, inspiring others to care more about the environment along the way.
 
Through the years, Captain Green has become a symbol for the “Clean and Green” movement which aims to inspire Singaporeans to care for and protect our environment by adopting a clean, green and sustainable lifestyle. He remains steadfast in his belief that the smallest gesture today can have a lasting impact on the environment tomorrow. His mission? To inspire others to join him in his quest to save the environment, one croak at a time.

Captain Green’s appearance was changed into an anthropomorphic superhero frog in 1997, complete with an orange cape and undies. On its chest was the old design of Captain Green. Given the title of “Defender of the Environment”, the mascot was featured in a series of comics about his environmental adventures.

The mascot’s superhero look was short-lived - the frog design was brought back and has been in use to this day. His current look has a wider face and wears a heart-shaped emblem, which symbolises his deep-rooted love for the environment. The emblem also acts as a beacon, reflecting environmental well-being, and not caring for the environment leaves him feeling far from hoppy.

He continues to be a ‘greenfluencer’ for NEA and Clean & Green Singapore, inspiring Singaporeans to care for and protect our environment by adopting a clean, green and sustainable lifestyle.

Before Captain Green, the Ministry of the Environment (of which NEA is a statutory board of) used an unnamed frog for a dengue fever awareness and prevention campaign.
