Captain Green is a mascot of the National Environment Agency (NEA). The frog mascot was introduced in 1990 during the inaugural Clean & Green Week to “raise social responsibilities and heighten environmental awareness on issues such as clean air, nature preservation, recycling, green consumerism and maintaining a litter-free environment".

Captain Green’s appearance was changed into an anthropomorphic superhero frog in 1997, complete with an orange cape and undies. On its chest was the old design of Captain Green. Given the title of “Defender of the Environment”, the mascot was featured in a series of comics about his environmental adventures.

The mascot’s superhero look was short-lived - the frog design was brought back and has been in use to this day. His current look has a wider face and a heart-shaped belly design.
