August is the official mascot of Singapore's National Day Parade (NDP). Introduced in NDP 2009 without a name, the Merlion mascot has since been regularly featured as the profile photo of <a href="https://www.facebook.com/NDPeeps/" target="_blank">NDPeeps</a>, the official social media channels of NDP. Its original design was a light-gray, chibi-ish Merlion with pointy ears.

From 2015, the mascot changed its colour to cream, and its expression became a happy wink.

In 2020, arms were added and the mascot wore a red tee and cap which covered its scales, simplifying the look further. Its colour also reverted to light-gray.

August was redesigned in 2021 by Corporal (NS) Royston Lim, then a full-time national serviceman. The refreshed design features heart-shaped scales and rounded arms, complete with a red tee that reads “I ❤️SG”. According to Royston, he was designed to look “like a mature young boy with child-like tendencies”.

The name "August" was chosen through a public online poll conducted by the NDP 2021 Committee, with the other options being Lionel and Lionity. According to the mascot’s lore, he was originally called "Ah Boy" before officially being named August.

Since his reintroduction, August has been prominently featured across NDPeeps’s various social media channels. He has had stints as a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uzbr8HMMCFg" target="_blank">Vtuber</a>, a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8AwUa6zEK5k" target="_blank">lofi boy</a> and a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecGZX8FIiIE" target="_blank">street interviewer</a>.
