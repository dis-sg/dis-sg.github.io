Frasia (pronounced "Fra-sher") served as the official mascot for the inaugural Asian Youth Games (AYG) held in Singapore in 2009. The name "Frasia" is a blend of "Friends" and "Asia," reflecting the mascot's role in fostering unity and friendship among Asian youth. This name was selected through a public naming contest, with the winning entry submitted by Michael Lye Quen Fong. 

Depicted as a sprightly lion who wears sneakers, Frasia embodied the values and spirit of the AYG, exemplifying friendship, respect, and excellence. He had different poses representing the three values, demonstrated in the video below.
