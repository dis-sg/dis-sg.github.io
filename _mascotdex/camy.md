Camy is a monster by the National Library Board (NLB). The mascot is part of <a href="https://www.nlb.gov.sg/main/site/discovereads/children/highlights/Copy-of-Monsters-United" target="_blank">Monsters United</a>, a group of four monsters designed to spark a love for reading and learning in children aged 7 to 9. The group includes Hutsy, Zecky, and Rooky, each introducing young readers to a different genre through activity booklets and online content. 

Camy represents the fantasy genre. The mascot has a pale yellow body and holds a wand. In 2022, an <a href="https://www.library.gov.sg/staticassets/monsters_gif_books/HowCamyGotHerWand/index.html" target="_blank">animated book</a> was published that tells the story of how Camy got her wand. Another <a href="https://www.library.gov.sg/staticassets/monsters_gif_books/monstersfinalbook/index.html" target="_blank">storybook</a> shared how the monsters found each other.
