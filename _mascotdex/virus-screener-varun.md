Virus Screener Varun was one of the five members of the Soaper 5, introduced by the Ministry of Education (MOE) in February 2020 to promote good hygiene practices among students during the COVID-19 pandemic. Each character embodies a specific health habit essential for preventing virus transmission - Virus Screener Varun’s role is to encourage daily temperature checks.

Virus Screener Varun’s backstory was shown in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/soaper5">The Soaper 5 Animated Series</a>, where he learnt he could zap viruses with his laser vision and made it his mission to get people to follow basic hygiene steps. He also began looking for other kids who could see viruses and formed the Soaper 5.

Virus Screener Varun’s initial costume was a red mask and a cardboard chestplate featuring a yellow star. After the Soaper 5 met Professor Moe, who upgraded their costumes, he wore a red and orange superhero suit and a red mask that covered his hair.

Together with the rest of the Soaper 5, Virus Screener Varun was featured in a rap song "Bye Bye Virus," which engaged students to practise good hygiene in a fun and memorable way.
