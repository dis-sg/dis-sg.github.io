Super Soaper Soffy was one of the five members of the Soaper 5, introduced by the Ministry of Education (MOE) in February 2020 to promote good hygiene practices among students during the COVID-19 pandemic. Each character embodies a specific health habit essential for preventing virus transmission - Super Soaper Soffy’s role is to promote regular handwashing with soap. Her superpower is the ability to shoot soap from her hands into the hands of others.

In the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/soaper5">The Soaper 5 Animated Series</a>, Super Soaper Soffy was shown to be third to join the Soaper 5, initially wearing a yellow tiara and yellow gloves. Her upgraded costume is a blue super suit with a cape.
