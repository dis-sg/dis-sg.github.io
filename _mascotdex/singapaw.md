SingaPaw is a lion mascot of the Singapore Discovery Centre (SDC), introduced in 2016 to engage visitors with the nation's history and inspire contributions to its future. 

The mascot’s design has changed over the years - its original design featured detailed eyes and an underbite, while the current version introduced in 2022 has bead eyes and a simple arch smile, giving it a tamer look. In both versions, SingaPaw has a spiky mane and wears a blue and white striped tee with an “S” on it.
