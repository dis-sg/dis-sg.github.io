Guardian Gabe is the dog mascot of the Insurance and Financial Practitioners Association of Singapore (IFPAS). This mascot has heterochromia, a condition with two differently coloured eyes—one blue and one orange—representing the association's colours. Dressed in knight's armour and holding the association's logo as a shield, Guardian Gabe represents IFPAS at events, roadshows, and community gatherings.

Its name was the winning entry of a naming contest, where the association bought advertising space on trains and buses to encourage public participation.
