Wipe Up Wilson was one of the five members of the Soaper 5, introduced by the Ministry of Education (MOE) in February 2020 to promote good hygiene practices among students during the COVID-19 pandemic. Each character embodies a specific health habit essential for preventing virus transmission - Wipe Up Wilson’s role is to highlight the importance of wiping down surfaces to maintain cleanliness.

In the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/soaper5">The Soaper 5 Animated Series</a>, Wipe Up Wilson was shown to be second to join the Soaper 5, initially wearing a half a paper plate with holes as a makeshift mask. Professor Moe gave him a green and lime superhero suit as an upgrade. He uses a sanitised hand towel as his weapon against viruses.

Together with the rest of the Soaper 5, Wipe Up Wilson was featured in a rap song "Bye Bye Virus," which engaged students to practise good hygiene in a fun and memorable way.
