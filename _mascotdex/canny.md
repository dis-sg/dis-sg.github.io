In November 2024, the Association of Banks in Singapore (ABS) introduced Canny the Chameleon as its official anti-scam mascot. Designed to serve as a visual reminder for consumers - especially children and youth - to remain vigilant against scams, Canny symbolises adaptability and awareness, traits essential for recognising and avoiding fraudulent activities.

Canny the Chameleon was created by 10-year-old Constance Ambre Le Grand de Mercey, whose design won the ABS Anti-Scam Mascot Design Competition in June 2024.

Local member banks of the ABS - DBS Bank, POSB, and UOB, will incorporate Canny into their public education initiatives to raise awareness about scams.

Canny will also appear on various merchandise such as T-shirts, alongside digital assets like online stickers.
