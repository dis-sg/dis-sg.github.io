<a href="https://designinsingapore.com/mascotdex/ally" target="_blank">Pan</a> and Ally are white bear mascots of the People's Association. Ally’s costume wears an open-mouth smile and is dressed in a red and pink dress with the PAssion logo. 

Both Pan and Ally have participated in various community events, including the Chingay Parade in 2017. In 2019, they joined other Singaporean mascots in a National Day reunion event organised by POSB's Smiley to raise funds for charity.
