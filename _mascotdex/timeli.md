Timeli, the rooster mascot for Singapore's National Punctuality Drive, was introduced during the campaign's launch by President Wee Kim Wee on 31 July 1993. As roosters are known for crowing at dawn, it symbolised punctuality and the start of a new day.

Timeli, whose name was selected as the winning entry in a naming contest, was dressed in an oversized blue suit paired with matching blue shorts, complemented by a red bowtie that matched the colour of his comb. His signature pose was him making an “OK” sign while glancing at the watch on his right hand.

Timeli's appearances were part of a broader push for overall punctuality—not just workplace timeliness. Restaurants were encouraged to display cardboard cutouts of the mascot, and <a href="https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/digitised/article/straitstimes19930818-1.2.33.6?qt=timeli&q=timeli" target="_blank">one restaurant</a> even organised a lucky draw during a wedding it hosted, rewarding guests who arrived early.
