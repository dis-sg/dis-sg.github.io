Designed in a clean and flat aesthetic, the orange mascot had a heart-shaped mane and tail tip. It wore a medal with the 17th SEA Games logo (a lion head symbol). Like many sporting event mascots, Singa was depicted in various athletic poses representing the 29 sports featured in the games.

Despite having the same name and being based off the same animal as <a href="https://www.designinsingapore.com/mascotdex/singa/" target="_blank">Singa the Kindness Lion</a>, they are not the same mascot.
