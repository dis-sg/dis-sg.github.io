Ray is the lion mascot of Police Pal, the Singapore Police Force’s (SPF) flagship programme for engaging primary school students. Evolving from the Young Police Buddy initiative by Bedok Police Division in 2019, the programme educates children on crime prevention and the role of the Police through interactive activities throughout their primary school years.

Ray’s name reflects his mission—to shed light on crime prevention and safety. He wears a police cap and a tie with the SPF chevron pattern.
