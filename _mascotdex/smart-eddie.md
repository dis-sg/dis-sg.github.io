In 2016, as part of the Sustainable Singapore Movement by the Ministry of the Environment and Water Resources in Singapore (now Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment), five mascots were introduced to encourage citizens to adopt more sustainable lifestyles. Each mascot was designed to personify various pillars of the Sustainable Singapore Blueprint, and they were collectively known as the Sustainable Singapore Blueprint Friends.

Smart Eddie is an owl mascot who represents Singapore’s “eco-smart endearing towns” pillar. A social media <a href="https://www.facebook.com/MSEsingapore/videos/1299537403430812/" target="_blank">post</a> by the Ministry explains his story: 

<blockquote>“Smart Eddie is a brilliant owl who believes that planning and intelligence are the keys to the future. From designing eco-smart endearing towns to smart homes, Eddie will help equip you with the knowledge and insights to discover new ideas on creating better living environments for everyone.”
</blockquote>

In 2021, the Sustainable Singapore Blueprint was succeeded by the SG Green Plan 2030. Although the five mascots are no longer actively used in the Ministry’s outreach efforts, they are still featured in SSB’s logo, while life-sized figures of the mascots continue to welcome visitors to the gallery.
