Tomeo is a male lion cub introduced by the Singapore Kindness Movement as part of the friend group of Singa known as the Kindness Cubbies. The group promotes kindness, empathy, and positive social behaviour through newsletters, games, and the animated series The Adventures of Singa and the Kindness Cubbies. Collectively, these activities and media are known as Kindsville, the initiative of the movement which focuses on children outreach.

The Kindsville website provides a write-up about Tomeo:

Tomeo is a thoughtful Kindness Cubbie who is Singa’s biggest fan! He looks up to Singa for everything that he isn’t. He is however a good cook who always rewards Singa and the Kindness Cubbies with the best burritos in Kindsville. The budding cook also whips up every time there is a party or celebration!
