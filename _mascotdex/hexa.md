<a href="https://www.designinsingapore.com/mascotdex/dotz/" target="_blank">Dotz</a> and Hexa are retired mascots of the Building and Construction Authority (BCA), representing the agency's commitment to universal design (UD), under the campaign Unify to UDify. Hexa is a small robot modelled after a flower. It has the power to modify structures to fit UD guidelines.

The mascots played a significant role in BCA's outreach initiatives about the importance of UD. Besides mascot meet-and-greets at events, visitors were given educational materials, such as a Universal Design comic book featuring the mascots and a UD Explorers Kit, to reinforce the concepts presented. They have also been part of physical interactive experiences like Yoodee Town and Yootropolis, where visitors could engage with UD features and participate in activities to deepen their understanding.

On BCAâ€™s Unify to UDify Facebook page, Dotz and Hexa promoted inclusivity in Singapore's built environment through animated videos, photo competitions and other social content.
