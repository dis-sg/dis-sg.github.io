Water Sally is one of the official mascots of PUB, Singapore’s National Water Agency. Designed as a pink, bubbly water droplet with a ponytail, she was introduced in 2020 to complement her brother, Water Wally, in promoting water conservation and sustainability among younger Singaporeans. An animated short film called "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rc3t01tZf4" target="_blank">Dear Water Sally</a>" was published as part of Water Sally’s nation-wide awareness campaign, where she was shown to travel the seven seas and witness many water crises around the world. With her global perspective on water sustainability, Water Sally is eager to use her knowledge and experience to promote water causes in Singapore.

As part of PUB's outreach efforts, Water Sally features prominently in educational initiatives, including the Water Wally & Sally Club, Singapore's first water-themed club for children aged 12 and below. This club offers a range of fun resources to educate children about climate change and water-related topics.

Both have since made appearances together at mascot meet-and-greets and content such as "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ko3066mb16g" target="_blank">The Adventures of Water Wally and Sally</a>" book series by Adeline Foo. In celebration of Singapore World Water Day 2021, PUB also partnered with Pinkfong for an original children’s song and dance called "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9aYJnjcmkg" target="_blank">Turn off the Tap</a>", featuring Baby Shark, Water Wally and Sally.
