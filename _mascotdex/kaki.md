Kaki is the mascot of OneService, an initiative by the Municipal Services Office (MSO) under the Ministry of National Development to promote active citizen participation in maintaining Singapore’s shared spaces. The name “Kaki” comes from the Singlish term for “buddy” or “friend,” symbolising community spirit and neighbourliness.

Kaki's design was selected through a mascot design competition, where the public voted on five shortlisted submissions: Beno, Kakki, One-Stop Jim, One One, and Mumu.
