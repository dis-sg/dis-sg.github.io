Kalleis a female lion cub introduced by the Singapore Kindness Movement as part of the friend group of Singa known as the Kindness Cubbies.

Collectively, these activities and media are known as Kindsville, the initiative of the movement which focuses on children outreach.

The Kindsville website provides a write-up about Kalle:

Kalle is a friendly, brave and outgoing Kindness Cubbie who is also the tough nut of the clique. She is like a big sister to Singa. Sometimes, she will bravely jump to shield him from any danger. To the rest of the Kindness Cubbies, however, she is extremely sweet and that’s why everyone adores her.
