Little Durian Star (榴莲小星) was Singapore's mascot for its pavilion at the Shanghai World Expo 2010. With a durian head and dressed in a red bodysuit featuring a Merlion design, the mascot was described as “an open, friendly and upbeat five-year-old Singaporean boy who travels around the world with his musician parents”.
