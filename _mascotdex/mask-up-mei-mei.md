Mask Up Mei Mei was one of the five members of the Soaper 5, introduced by the Ministry of Education (MOE) in February 2020 to promote good hygiene practices among students during the COVID-19 pandemic. Each character embodies a specific health habit essential for preventing virus transmission - Mask Up Mei Mei’s role is to promote wearing masks properly. She is able to create masks with her hands on demand.

In the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/soaper5">The Soaper 5 Animated Series</a>, Mask Up Mei Mei was shown to be the last to join the Soaper 5, initially wearing a scuba diving mask to conceal her identity. After the Soaper 5’s meeting with Professor Moe, she wore a pink super suit with a pink mask.

Together with the rest of the Soaper 5, Mask Up Mei Mei was featured in a rap song "Bye Bye Virus," which engaged students to practise good hygiene in a fun and memorable way.
