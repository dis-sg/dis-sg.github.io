The Singapore Cancer Society (SCS) introduced Dr Maxine, a pink humanoid mascot, in 2018 to promote the importance of HPV immunisation to young girls. Her name aligns with the SCS HPV Education and Immunisation Programmeâ€™s 2018 tagline, "Immunise to Maximise," which incorporates the words "MAXimise" and "VaccINE."

Dr Maxine is usually featured as cutout boards at SCS events, where she is shown holding a cervical screening tool (likely a cervical biopsy punch), exaggerated to look like a gun. She also appears in public service announcement videos.
