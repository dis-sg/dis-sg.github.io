The mascots played a significant role in BCA's outreach initiatives about the importance of UD. Besides mascot meet-and-greets at events, visitors were given educational materials, such as a Universal Design comic book featuring the mascots and a UD Explorers Kit, to reinforce the concepts presented. They have also been part of physical interactive experiences like Yoodee Town and Yootropolis, where visitors could engage with UD features and participate in activities to deepen their understanding.
