CPT Ted is the official mascot of the Republic of Singapore Air Force (RSAF). Depicted as a teddy bear dressed in a pilot's uniform, CPT Ted was introduced to engage the public and foster a deeper connection with the RSAF's activities and personnel. The mascot has been featured in various RSAF events and on social media, often seen exploring different air bases and squadrons. 

CPT Ted also makes appearances at RSAF events, such as the RSAF55 Open House. Visitors could take photos with the live-sized inflated mascot and post them on <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@thersaf/video/7277537363687968007" target="_blank">social media</a> to win CPT Ted plushies.
