Captain Leo is one of the mascots of the biennial Singapore Airshow, Asia's largest aerospace and defence exhibition. Introduced in 2013, the lion mascot is often dressed in a black flight jacket and goggles, and was joined by a lioness counterpart <a href="https://www.designinsingapore.com/mascotdex/leonette/" target="_blank">Leonette</a> in 2016.

Both Leo and Leonette are often featured on the Singapore Airshow’s social media channels - Leo has a content series called Captain Leo’s Aviation Trivia, where he shares fun facts about the aviation industry. The duo also meet-and-greet visitors during the airshow.
