Bloobin is the recycling mascot introduced by Clean & Green Singapore (under the National Environment Agency or NEA) as part of their 'Recycle Right' campaign. Designed to resemble NEA’s blue recycling bin deployed at residential estates and offices, Bloobin aims to educate the public on proper recycling practices.

Clean & Green Singapore provides a write-up on Bloobin’s backstory on its website:

<i>Twenty years ago, Bloobin started out as a dreamer full of hope. He believed that when everyone came together to recycle, we could create a greener Singapore with less waste sent to Semakau Landfill.</i>

<i>Over the years however, Bloobin became increasingly frustrated due to constant bin contamination. People had been treating the blue recycling bins as trash bins, throwing all sorts of rubbish into them and causing recyclables to be contaminated. Common contaminants include food and liquid waste, tissue paper, Styrofoam, electronic waste, furniture and items meant for reuse, such as clothing, toys and shoes.</i>

<i>Having had enough of the years of abuse and misuse, Bloobin is now on a mission to get everyone to recycle right. He wants everyone to join him to increase our recycling rates and extend the lifespan of Semakau Landfill.</i>

With large oval eyes and prominent concave eyebrows, Bloobin is usually portrayed with a smirk or a frown. His logo is designed like graffiti, which fits his rough and grouchy personality.

In 2023, a campaign called “Treat Bloobin Better” highlighted accurate disposing of items in blue recycling bins. Videos were produced showing Bloobin falling ill because non-recyclables such as foods and liquids were being thrown into Bloobin.

An interactive <a href="https://www.cgs.gov.sg/recycleright/check-my-item/" target="_blank">WhatsApp and Telegram chatbot</a> featuring Bloobin was launched in 2024 to assist users in determining whether specific items can be recycled, further promoting correct recycling habits.
