Mr Zebra was introduced in 2011 as part of a road safety initiative by the Singapore Road Safety Council, Traffic Police, People’s Association, and the Automobile Association of Singapore. Serving as an ambassador for road safety, Mr Zebra promoted the slogan "Be Seen, Be Safe. Every Life Matters."

Dressed in a yellow tee with the URL “Saferoads.sg”, a life-sized Mr Zebra mascot engaged the public at campaign events, spreading awareness about road safety. The campaign also featured various promotional materials, including posters, car decals, bookmarks, and leaflets, to educate road users.

To reach younger audiences, 3D-style cartoons featuring Mr Zebra were also produced, covering essential road safety topics like kerb drills and the importance of using designated crossings. These videos were shared online to maximise their outreach.
