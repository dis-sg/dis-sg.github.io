Teamy the Productivity Bee was introduced in 1982 as the mascot for Singapore's National Productivity Campaign. The National Productivity Board (NPB) selected a bee to symbolise industriousness and teamwork, qualities essential for enhancing productivity. The name "Teamy" is derived from the word "team", emphasising the importance of collaboration in the workplace.

The creators considered both a bee and an ant for the mascot but ultimately chose the bee, as it could fly, representing the ability to reach greater heights. To make Teamy appear friendly and approachable, the bee's sting was omitted from the design.

Teamy played a central role in annual productivity campaigns throughout the 1980s and 1990s, promoting efficiency and innovation in Singapore’s workforce. The mascot was featured in various media, including The Adventures of Teamy the Bee comic strip in the Singapore Productivity News newsletter, appealing to both adults and children. Additionally, Teamy’s advertisements would feature a jingle that goes “Good, better, best! Never let it rest. Till the good is better, and the better best!”, enhancing memorability. 

In 1999, after 17 years of service, Teamy was retired. However, it continues to make appearances in national celebrations such as the National Day Parade in recognition of its status as one of the most recognisable local mascots. In 2022, he was featured in a Singapore Post mascot stamp series alongside Water Sally, Merli, and more.
