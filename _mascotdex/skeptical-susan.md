Her personal <a href="https://www.reach.gov.sg/who-we-are/reach-characters">statement</a> is: “I go through so much news I don’t know what to trust anymore! I like using social media but it’s so hard to be sure of anything these days!”

Skeptical Susan has been featured in REACH's social media content such as comics, which tackle hot button issues of the day like discrimination and mental wellbeing.
