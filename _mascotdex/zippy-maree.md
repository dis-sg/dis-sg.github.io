In 2016, as part of the Sustainable Singapore Movement by the Ministry of the Environment and Water Resources in Singapore (now Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment), five mascots were introduced to encourage citizens to adopt more sustainable lifestyles. Each mascot was designed to personify various pillars of the Sustainable Singapore Blueprint, and they were collectively known as the Sustainable Singapore Blueprint Friends.

Zippy Maree is a butterfly mascot who represents a car-lite Singapore. A social media <a href="https://www.facebook.com/MSEsingapore/videos/1303323399718879/" target="_blank">post</a> by the Ministry explains her story: 

<blockquote>“Maree was once a crawling caterpillar but became a beautiful butterfly when she chose to transform her mindset and lifestyle and adopted an alternative, greener means of transport. That is why her friends now call her Zippy Maree because she can move confidently from place to place with ease while enjoying a healthier lifestyle.”</blockquote>

In 2021, the Sustainable Singapore Blueprint was succeeded by the SG Green Plan 2030. Although the five mascots are no longer actively used in the Ministry’s outreach efforts, they are still featured in SSB’s logo, while life-sized figures of the mascots continue to welcome visitors to the gallery.
