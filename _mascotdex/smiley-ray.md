In 2016, as part of the Sustainable Singapore Movement by the Ministry of the Environment and Water Resources in Singapore (now Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment), five mascots were introduced to encourage citizens to adopt more sustainable lifestyles. Each mascot was designed to personify various pillars of the Sustainable Singapore Blueprint, and they were collectively known as the Sustainable Singapore Blueprint Friends.

Smiley Ray is a sun mascot who represents Singapore’s goal as a leading green economy.

In 2021, the Sustainable Singapore Blueprint was succeeded by the SG Green Plan 2030. Although the five mascots are no longer actively used in the Ministry’s outreach efforts, they are still featured in SSB’s logo, while life-sized figures of the mascots continue to welcome visitors to the gallery.
