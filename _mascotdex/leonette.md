Captain Leonette is one of the mascots of the biennial Singapore Airshow, Asia's largest aerospace and defence exhibition. Introduced in 2016 as the lioness counterpart of <a href="https://www.designinsingapore.com/mascotdex/leo/" target="_blank">Leo</a>, Leonette has a ponytail and usually wears a flight jacket with a matching dark skirt. According to her biography, she excels in radar operations and aircraft communications to help the pilots reach their destination safely.
