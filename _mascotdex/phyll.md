Phyll the Leaf is the mascot of the NParks Explore A Route (NEAR), a <a href="https://near.nparks.gov.sg/about" target="_blank">mobile app</a> by the National Parks Board (NParks). The leaf mascot appears throughout the app, including its AR mode where Phyll and its friends would share nuggets of information about the flora and fauna found around the various checkpoints along nature trails.
