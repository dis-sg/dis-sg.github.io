Introduced in 2020 by the National Museum of Singapore during the pandemic, when museum visits were prohibited, Dome Bot is a <a href="https://v360.nhb.gov.sg/nms" target="_blank">chatbot</a> that allowed visitors to engage with exhibits remotely using their phone browsers. By scanning QR codes at the exhibits, visitors could access complementary audio and visual clips to enhance their museum experience.

The chatbot also has interactive activities such as an Architectural Tour of the museum which features 3D Augmented Reality models to explore.
