Water Wally is one of the official mascots of PUB, Singapore’s National Water Agency. Introduced in 2005 to promote water conservation and raise awareness about the importance of water resources, particularly among young children, the blue water droplet mascot is regularly featured in various educational materials, events, and campaigns by PUB. 

Notably, Water Wally starred in a nine-episode animated series in 2009 titled "The Adventures of Water Wally", aimed at educating children on water-related topics. Another popular video was Water Wally’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUrZ2W09R7c" target="_blank">Shower Dance of 2011</a>, which became a local meme as Water Wally supposedly walked into the toilet while a kid was showering.

Water Wally’s original design depicted him reflecting light, as represented by a white exclamation mark diagonally above its face. The current version of Water Wally is a simpler look with a lighter shade of blue.

In 2020, PUB introduced Water Wally's sister, Water Sally, to further enhance public engagement on water conservation issues. Both have since made appearances together at mascot meet-and-greets and content such as “The Adventures of Water Wally and Sally” book series. In celebration of Singapore World Water Day 2021, PUB also partnered with Pinkfong for an original children’s song and dance called “Turn off the Tap”, featuring Baby Shark, Water Wally and Sally.
