Tosh is a male lion cub introduced by the Singapore Kindness Movement as part of the friend group of Singa known as the Kindness Cubbies. The group promotes kindness, empathy, and positive social behaviour through newsletters, games, and the animated series The Adventures of Singa and the Kindness Cubbies. Collectively, these activities and media are known as Kindsville, the initiative of the movement which focuses on children outreach.
