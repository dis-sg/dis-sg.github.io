MICOS is a retired mascot of Chai Chee Constituency’s annual Good Neighbours’ Day. Launched in 1982 by MP Fong Sip Chee, MICOS promotes neighbourliness, harmony and tolerance among the 40,000 residents in the constituency. MICOS may be an acronym for “Malays, Indians, Chinese and Other Singaporeans”, but his appearance is stereotypically Chinese, with fair skin, a buck toothed smile and slit eyes.

A wide range of publicity materials were printed for the campaign that featured MICOS including posters, booklets and stickers. MICOS also appeared as a laser beam projection on a 16-storey HDB block in 1982 during the campaign.

After the campaign, MICOS was tapped to support other causes such as explaining the Medisave scheme or encouraging Chai Chee residents to conserve water. These MICOS-branded messages were printed on stickers and pamphlets.
