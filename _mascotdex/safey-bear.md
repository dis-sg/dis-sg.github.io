Safey the Safety First Bear was introduced by the Traffic Police during the 1986 Road Safety Campaign through a series of comic strips designed to educate children about road safety. These strips were featured in popular family magazines like Bookworm Family and Bookworm Digest.

Apart from comic strips, Safey Bear was also featured in televised safety filmlets, and on printed tees. Additionally, about 6,000 Safey Bear toys were produced and sold at the Road Safety Park, department stores, and neighbourhood shops to further promote the road safety message.
