COLin is the mascot of the Singapore Prison Service (SPS). Depicted in a cartoonish aesthetic as an SPS officer in uniform, complete with a lanyard, COLin often makes appearances at SPS events and on the service’s social media channels.

His name is inspired by SPS’ positioning that its officers are Captains of Lives (COL).
