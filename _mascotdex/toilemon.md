Toilemon is a mascot of the Public Hygiene Council’s (PHC) Keep Singapore Clean campaign. Introduced alongside <a href="https://designinsingapore.com/mascotdex/trashemon" target="_blank">Trashemon</a> and <a href="https://designinsingapore.com/mascotdex/trayremon" target="_blank">Trayremon</a>, the KeepSGClean Supermons (as they are collectively known) encourage Singaporeans to uphold higher standards of hygiene and cleanliness in their everyday lives.

Toilemon’s design does not just draw influence from a toilet bowl - instead of pipes, he has a reptile-like tail at the back of his body. He has toilet paper rolls for eyes and his lips are the toilet bowl lid.  

Besides being featured on PHC’s social media channels, the council collaborated with the tertiary institutions to create KeepSGClean Supermons content, from animated videos in partnership with Nanyang Polytechnic in 2024 to a <a href="https://www.publichygienecouncil.sg/initiatives/story-writing-competition/" target="_blank">story writing competition</a> in partnership with Temasek Polytechnic.
