“Dino Loves Monuments” was a 2018 campaign by the National Heritage Board (NHB) to promote awareness of Singapore’s national monuments. Dino, in the form of a large, inflatable mascot balloon, popped up at various national monuments (such as the National Museum) each weekend for close to two months. Visitors who posted photos of Dino on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/NationalHeritageBoardSG/posts/pfbid02unmwps5uknk4yhog3uoimRCk3jpE2XzjQu9geQfKJA69BeWAuq4x1phZNdDcQmTol" target="_blank">social media</a> had a chance to win limited edition Dino toys and museum merchandise. 

Dino’s design was inspired by the T-rex and ice cream - it has a pink stocky body with white spots resembling ice cream splats and an ice cream cone as a tail.
