In 2011, Singapore hosted the 3rd ASEAN Schools Games (ASG). Sean the Lion was the official mascot, with its name being an acronym for "South East Asian Nations". Depicted as a spirited young lion dressed in red and white with a wide, open-mouth smile, Sean represented Singapore as a welcoming host country. 

During the Games, Singapore's men's vault star Sean Lim and gymnast Phaan Yilin presented a plush toy of Sean the Lion to then President S R Nathan during a courtesy call by athletes and officials from seven participating nations at the Istana.
