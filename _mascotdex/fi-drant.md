Fi-Drant was a mascot introduced in 1987 by the National Fire Prevention Council (now National Fire and Emergency Preparedness Council) as part of a nationwide fire prevention campaign. The fire hydrant-shaped mascot, wearing a firefighter’s helmet, symbolised firemen and their role in combating fires.

Fi-Drant’s arch-nemesis was the Fire Devil—a flaming skull and crossbones representing the dangers of fire. Both characters were brought to life in full-body costumes and engaged in skits at exhibitions, where Fi-Drant would always triumph over the Fire Devil, reinforcing fire safety messages.
