Greco, a tall white building with solar panels and a green roof, symbolised "Green Construction". The mascot advocated for eco-friendly building methods, energy efficiency, and the use of sustainable materials. Together with Beco, they serve as ambassadors for BCA’s initiatives in fostering a greener and more sustainable built environment.

The duo was frequently featured in BCA’s outreach programmes, events, and educational campaigns, engaging students and industry professionals to raise awareness about sustainable construction practices and the BCA Green Mark, which certified green buildings. Two children's books featuring Greco and Beco were also distributed to schools, which aimed to inspire students to initiate green projects, such as setting up green corners.
