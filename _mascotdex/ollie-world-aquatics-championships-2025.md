Ollie (not to be confused with GovTech’s <a href="https://www.designinsingapore.com/mascotdex/ollie/" target="_blank">Ollie</a>) is an otter mascot of the 22nd World Aquatics Championships 2025, held in Singapore. Ollie, together with fellow mascot <a href="https://www.designinsingapore.com/mascotdex/dewey" target="_blank">Dewey the Dugong</a>, were introduced at a press event 100 days from the start of the championship.

The championship’s website shares more about Ollie in a write-up:

<i>“Cheeky and cheerful, Ollie the urban otter has found a special home in Singapore - not just in the waterways, but also in the hearts of its people! Often seen cruising through the waters of our Garden City or playfully traversing Singapore’s bustling streets, Ollie is a familiar and beloved sight. An excellent swimmer, Ollie’s smooth, fur-covered body sleekly glides through the water before popping up with a friendly wave for fans on land. Ollie is the embodiment of ‘water alongside land’ and ‘nature alongside civilisation'.”</i>

The store describes each figurine:

Soldier Ollie – A tribute to every Singaporean son’s rite of passage, from BMT to ORD. Army, police, or civil defense—he wears his uniform with pride!

Uncle Ollie – The true heartland legend, running on kopi-O, nostalgia, and sharp Singlish one-liners. Found at the kopitiam, debating why “last time better, lah!”

Durian Lover Ollie – The ultimate durian connoisseur, mastering the “smell and shake” technique to pick the creamiest, most shiok Mao Shan Wang.
