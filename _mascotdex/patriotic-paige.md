Patriotic Paige is a mascot for REACH Singapore. Designed as one of the common archetypes of Singaporeans, she wears a Merlion-shaped hair clip. REACH <a href="https://www.reach.gov.sg/who-we-are/reach-characters">describes</a> her as “proud to be a Singaporean and loves wearing red shirt and white bottoms”.
