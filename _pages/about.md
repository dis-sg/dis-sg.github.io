Design In Singapore (DIS) is an exploration of local culture through the lens of design. Since 2017 via <a href="https://www.brandingsingapore.blogspot.com">Branding Singapore</a>, we have featured visual identities of local brands to inform and inspire. DIS is a continuation of this mission, with the inclusion of other design fields such as architecture and advertising. 

DIS has 3 goals:


<h3>Demystify the design process</h3>
Like good design, good journalism does not discriminate; all are welcomed on this journey of discovery, regardless of prior design knowledge. DIS emphasises on using easy-to-understand design vocabulary to ensure as many readers understand the creative process.


<h3>Promote the appreciation of good design</h3>
Bad design is almost always noticable while good design is often taken for granted. DIS would uncover hidden design gems which can change your perspective on the importance of design and give credit where it is due. 


<h3>Document Singapore's design journey</h3>
Singapore has come a long way in its design journey, and DIS stands ready to facilatate and document the next chapter of Singaporean creativity through collaboration. 


By acheving these goals, we hope to elevate the quality of design knowledge and discussion among Singaporeans. 

Take a break from the hectic Singapore lifestyle. Welcome to your creative escape.
